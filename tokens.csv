Tengo
una
semana
estar
utilizando
este
telfono
celular
primer
Nokia
principio
fue
poco
frustrante
por
que
saba
donde
buscar
las
aplicaciones
estaba
acostumbrado
los
celulares
Sony
Ericksson
senta
muy
cmodo
con
ellos
pero
por
las
caractersticas
que
presentaba
gran
cantidad
memoria
ser
tecnologa
los
buenos
comentarios
que
haba
escuchado
por

decid
comprarlo
lugar
Sony
ErickssonComo
mencion
principio
frustr
pero
era
mas
por
desconocimiento
que
otra
cosa
por
ejemplo
instal

Opra
mini
que
navegador
que
trae
gustaba
pero
cuando
conectaba

haca
atravez
del

saba
que
tena
que
entrar
aplicaciones
accesar

Pero
poco
poco
fui
encontrandole
las

debo
decir

sacar
del

aunque
repito

aun
como
con

ese
problema
todos
los

telfono
robusto
fuerte
aunque
aun
llevado
ningn
golpe
Tiene
todas
las
funciones
los
telfonos
convencionales
pero
diferencia
otros
estas
realmente
cumplen
por
ejemplo
tienes
una
grabadora
esperas
que
cuando
des
click
esta
realmente
grabe
esta
hace
tenido
telefonos
que
cuando
quise
usar
grabadora
esta
simplemente
funcion
Puedes
vivar
con
ello
pero
clera
que
una
aplicacin
funcione
como
debieraPero
bueno
todo
perfecto
que
gust
incmodo
que
resulta
veces

veces
cuando
estoy
navegando
por
alguna
razn
tengo
que
digitar
algo
puedo
desplegar
texto
pantalla
pero
otras
ocasiones
esta
caracterstica
esta
disponible
obliga
usar
teclado
falta
costumbre
pero
soy
mucho
mas
diestro
con
las
teclas
telfono
que
con
este
tipo
teclado
demoro
mucho
por
que
resulta
engorroso
Pero
bueno
talvez
dentro
unos
meses
halla
acostumbradoPero
por
dems
creo
que
son
mucho
mas
las
satisfacciones
imaginense
pueden
utilizar
este
telfono
como
GPS
particular
uso
por
que
tengo

que
una
belleza
cual
estoy
super
acostumbrado
