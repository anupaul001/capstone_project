You have to manually update the phone, no “Over the Air” update, since the SKU is “CN” (check the box the phone was shipped in) but the installed software was “WW” (check “about” phone in settings). So unless you are technically adept you most likely won’t be able to update this particular configuration. My phone had outdated firmware. On the plus side the phone I received was “rooted” probably so they could install the appropriate OS for the region the phone was being sold to.

"ASUS ZenFone 2 (ZE551ML) Unlocked Cellphone,5.5 inch 4GB RAM 32GB ROM Android 5.0 Smartphone.(Gray)",Samsung,NA,4," First let me begin with a specific piece of information that I think needs to be stated. I will test this phone with a SIM borrowed but I won't really be using it long term with cellular service at this time. I do want to offer an opinion on call and reception quality though so it will be tested in this way.Results... calls are clear on both ends without any issues and seems to be working fine in relation to both 3G and 4G.On to the rest of the phone done with the pro/con format:Pro:Big screen, bright and easy to see.MicroSD expansion option3000mAh batteryPretty good cameras (mostly the rear is what I care about)Lot of memoryNice colorDual SIM (not that I'm likely to use it though)Cons:Plastic (I'm used to aluminum phones)Fixed batteryLower clocked CPU @ 1.8Ghz (Quad core though)Button placement (biggest con for me)Speakers (I'm used to front facing Harman Kardon speakers)Additional thoughts:The interface is a love hate thing for most people. I really love the HTC Sense GUI and so I am used to that in my last three phones. The Asus Zen GUI is really nice and many useful Asus apps are included. The layout I was originally concerned about but turns out I could VERY easily live with it daily. I was very pleasantly shocked by how smooth and fast and intuitive things are with this phone. In the end it comes down to personal preference. (I really dislike the Samsung GUI for example but like their hardware).Price... I feel for the speed and overall look and feel and being unlocked it is a very good phone, feels a lot like a flagship model in operation also it doesn't offer all the bells and whistles some phones are currently sporting.Question:Since I am not using it like a normal cell phone why do I want it?Answer:I dislike killing my main phone's battery and want the portability of a phone but the functionality of a tablet. This phablet is the perfect compromise offering a great size and feature set.I have a drone that needs a phone to control it and portability is an important factor so this is a nice quick device that I am hoping works well to use with my drone as the remote control. Around WiFi I can surf the web and check emails and not use my main cell. Also nice to have a backup phone and I may even use this as a pay as you go option at some point so I didn't want to get into big money with a phone to find out I won't use it.So plenty of good and not so good but overall none of the cons are all that bad considering $250 beats $600+. If you can use this phone on your network then I don't think you can go wrong with it.Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.",3

Rather than go into detail over the phone's features and beat a dead horse (CNET has a very comprehensive review you can read), I'll discuss the ""buying experience.""I purchased this phone from an Amazon Fulfilled vendor called ""The Wireless Circle"" (received it within 2 days via Prime!), It came delivered in a standard Amazon cardboard box and the phone itself in typical Samsung packaging, brand new, with a quick-start booklet, headphones, USB 3.0 cable, and a charging plug. The battery was already fully charged.I am an AT&T customer, but the website and the store were going to charge me $519 plus shipping, and no phones were available within a three-store radius where I live (Hah!). I did some online research and realized buying an unlocked phone was the way to go. I could write an essay on the differences between an unlocked and contract-free phone (just Google it) but if it helps - Since I am an AT&T customer, buying an unlocked AT&T phone meant all I needed to do was take it to the store for activation. Even then, all I needed to do when I got there was replace my SIM card.Ergo: I SAVED MONEY by purchasing an unlocked phone. No more 2-year contracts for me!

The camera is fairly good too, 16mp and great 1080p video. It has a smooth motion setting that makes your video incredibly clear and smooth frame rate. So far I am absolutely loving it.

I didn't drop this crap phone from a great hight, it was only like 3 feet. So the repair would have cost $200+ No way in hell I was going to pay another 200+ to fix a 3 month old phone that has a LCD screen so delicate that even in a phone case it can not handle a 3 foot drop.

It came as ATT branded (as advetrtised) and was unlocked. The call quality is good, battery life is excellent (especially after disabling all the ATT bloatware). The screen is bright and adapts to the lighting conditions. This phone runs all the apps and updated itself to the latest version of Android, no help from me. Six month later the USB port gave up and it became very difficult to charge this phone. I have to do it during the day, while I work, as the connector needs to be adjusted (pushed in or to a side) to deliver chargin current to the phone. Quoted price to repair (repalce the USB daughterboard) is $120-$150, almost the price of the new phone. So it gets one star because of the bad USB port. Seller - Cell2U4less delivered the phone promptly and in a good condition (looked as if like new). Unsure, if this is Samsung fault or something else went wrong. On my part, there was no abuse of the phone or the USB port. On a visual inspection, there is no damage to the USB port, no bent pins etc. So that is $325 loss after less than one year.

Bottom line is this - if you buy a phone from an unauthorized seller, such as Alpha Cell, you can kiss your factory warranty goodbye and, will be stuck with a defective phone should anything go wrong.

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,1,"I bought this phone after using a Samsung Galaxy S4 for 1.5 years. My Galaxy S4's both microphone and speaker stopped functioning in 3 months after I bought it (which apparently was a very frequent failure of S4), and after 1.5 year of usage one day the phone started to getting into a bootloop and freezing in 1 minute everytime I would turn it on. I sent it to repair and I had to pay for Samsung to fix it since warranty was already over. So for Samsung it is normal that your phone becomes useless in less than 1.5 year you buy it.After 1.5 years with Samsung galaxy S4, I wanted to try the Galaxy S5 and hence I bought this phone. In 7 months my phone stopped functioning again, and again the problem was software failure. I called the repair center, asked them if they can retrieve the photos first before fixing it, and they said they would delete everything as a policy. So I went to a repair shop in New York and asked them to reciver my photos. Next I sent my phone to Samsung. Now Samsung is rejecting to repair the phone claiming that a different O/S is installed and hence the phone is out of warranty. They are not taking any responsibility on the fact that if there is a different O/S installed in the phone that is because their phone stopped functioning within months of purchasing it again (just as my Galaxy S4 experience). The person from the customer service that I talked also repeated himself life a robot saying that the phone is out of warranty, and he did not make any comments on the fact that they should take responsibility on the fact that the phone stopped functioning at the first place. Low quality products, low quality customer service summarizes Samsung, so you should all stay away from their products.",0

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,1,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a fantastic phone, but the one I received from this seller was defective. I didn't find out until after it was activated, so this presents a big problem for me. The problem is that the it won't charge the battery. The first time it charged the battery to 40% and that is when I had to take it to the AT&T store to get it activated. When I returned home, I put it back on charge and let it charge for a couple of hours before I returned to get it. The phone was not charging, and it was 1% changed. I reset the phone and it charged again, when it got to 30%, I installed the update. I thought the update might fix the charging problem. After the update, the phone was reset while it finished installing, that all went fine. I saw that the phone was charging so I left it on the charger and went o sleep. When I returned, 7 hours later, it had stopped charging, and the phone was charged to 19%. So all the problems with the phone have to do with the charging. I also tried the finger print scanner as a method to unlock the phone, but after it was trained, it took way to many tries to get it to read my finger correctly. It was a good thing that the phone had a backup password that could bypass the finger print. I don't know if I should order another one of these phones, I am pretty sure they are refurbished phones, but they avoid saying that in the description.",12

So after $70.00 to unlock the phone and $50.00 for a new sims card my phone is working now at times. My carrier stated this is because it's an AT&T phone so issues may come up. It was a learning experience. I didn't know that Metro PCS had S5 phones still to sell I won't of had any issues if I bought a phone from them. Also after spending $219.00 on the phone plus $120 I could of save myself $20.00 because Metro PCS has them for $320.00.

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,4,"I wanted to buy a ""new"" unlocked phone that would work on the AT&T network here in Alaska. I did a lot of research to ensure this model would work best on their network. It appears that most/ (maybe all) GSM phones with work world-wide on other GSM networks. However, from my research, it seems as though not every GSM phone will with perform as well as the ""branded"" models that are designed for use on their networks. This appears to especially hold true for what data speed you can potentially connect with i.e., 3G maximum or 4G LTE service.I ordered a new phone and that is exactly what I got. It still had the protective film over all the ports, etc. and the phone clock only had a few minutes of QC test-time on it. It came with a battery, wall charger, ear-buds and instructions. I did have to go to the AT&T store to have them install a micro-SIM because my old phone used the mini-SIM so I could not simply swap it out between the two phones.Overall this a very nice high-end phone. Fast, with a crisp & clear screen. Seems to be working fine on my network and it connects to the LTE signals when I'm in range of those cell towers.",9

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,4,"So far, so good. I hesitate to give five stars, simply because I've only had this phone for a week. My primary concern with this kind of purchase, as is demonstrated in some reviews with such products, is whether this previous generation of smartphone is truly new and authentic. Once the newest and hottest smartphone version hits the market, any remaining new stock of the previous version is discontinued or swiped up fast (particularly if the previous version is better than the newest). As anyone who has been looking for these models can attest, a lot of the options are refurbished, open-box, unlocked, or most importantly claimed as new but not really. Then you have the issue with whether the model is ""international"", GSM or something else that might prevent it from doing what the buyer wants it to do.So, I'm happy that I found this at a reasonable price and from a seller that I was able to research and develop some confidence in. I was also able to rely on the Amazon return policy in case things didn't work out. BlutekUSA is the seller, in my case, and I have been quite happy with the result. I believe the phone is indeed new, and perhaps even factory-unlocked versus the seller doing it. And it is the real deal, with all the standard, original accessories included.The phone itself works quite well, compared to my Galaxy S3. I have T-Mobile, and this is an AT&T unlocked phone (that's what the ""A"" means, in the G900A model), but I was able to simply take my SIM out of my old phone and insert it into the new phone, do some manual setting of the 4G ling so that I could highlight and pick T-Mobile (more networks, mobile networks, APN setting to T-Mobile), and everything works fine. The performance is improved. The battery is stronger, longer lasting and recharges much faster than the Galaxy S3. It was already updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop, and while not a rooted device, I'm satisfied with the operation.",2

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,5,"This review is for the Galaxy S5 specifically from Bluetek. The phone I received from this company was new and in original packaging. A charger, battery and earbuds were included. The phone arrived well packed and in perfect condition. Everything works perfectly and I am very happy with the product. My only complaint is all the bloat ware that is included with these phones but that is Samsung, not the vendor. If this is the phone you want then I would recommend this vendor as being reliable.",0

Besides having a few scuff marks the box it cam in was generic not a Samsung box and the battery was in the phone. While on the phone the person on the other end had a horrible echo. The speaker did not work so no speaker phone and while face timing the receiver could not here. Had to hook it up to my blue tooth. Anyway to much work for a phone that was supposedly new. Supplier was BREED. Sending it back now. On top of getting a crappy phone i had to pay for return shipping.,0

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,4,"I ordered this item from seller Wireless Experts, Inc. and so far Im VERY happy with this purchase. The item was suppose to arrive on friday but actually came in 2 days early on Wed and all emails/questions were answered proptly from this seller. Still getting use to and trying everything out but so far no problems. The area i live in is mainly covered by AT&T (Southcentral KY and most of TN) which is why I chose this version of the galaxy so I could make sure it all worked. I use this phone with pre paid straight talk and have no issue, phone works and so does the 4G and 4G LTE internet is blazing fast. Ive had other friends buy other unlocked phones and have problems with 4G LTE off of the AT&T towers but being this is an AT&T version you shouldnt have any issue in areas covered by them (Or as in my case any pre paid service that works off the AT&T network like straight talk). One minor downside is even tho its unlocked all AT&T software/apps CAN NOT be uninstalled only disabled but for me its not a real big issue",48

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,3,"Purchased the S5 from ""Supreme Deals"" as a replacement for my wife's Nexus 5 that quit. However the S5 came with a defective camera. Returned it with shipping paid and label provided by seller. So the return process was very good and timely. Wish this phone would have worked because I have one through work. It is a great phone. I purchased a second S5 this time through ""Celltronics."" But I had to return it too, at my cost this time, because it had a defective cell receiver and would not receive cell signals in my house where the Nexus 5 easily did before. I gave up and bought a new Moto G 4th Generation which works great and has a clean Android system. It also has no legacy AT&T apps like the cheap S5's I had to deal with. I'm not sure the quality of the S5's being sold is up to par. Are these phones defective? Is that why they are < $300. Could be. Don't waster your time.",2

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,1,"I specifically bought this version of the galaxy (rather than the newer s6) because it claimed to be waterproof. It wasn't. Accidentally dropped it into some water (with all of the ports sealed and the back case on), and now it is dead. I tried to dry it out, but it is still dead. Of course the warranty doesn't cover water damage... even though they market the phone as being protected against just this scenario. I was a loyal Samsung customer, but this is absolutely the last Samsung I will ever buy. I have also become THAT person who rails against Samsung at every opportunity. I will probably get some tee shirts made at the local airbrushing place at the mall with ""Samsung Lies"" printed across them, with a sad, dead, phone, slowly leaking water in the background. I will insist that all members of my family wear these shirts whenever they are in public. The kids will probably be happy with this arrangement, since they wanted iPhones anyway. Maybe I'll hang a bedsheet with ""Don't believe Samsung!"" hastily scrawled on it with dripping shoe polish from my balcony. I'll lose all of my remaining friends (I have no idea how many friends I have left since my calls and texts have gone unanswered for days now), and have to resort to writing craigslist ads for new friends and a new phone, and then I'll probably get murdered. All because I bought this stupid phone. Thanks, Samsung. Thanks for ruining my life.BTW, when it worked (for a month, before it's ""waterproofing"" didn't do it's job) the phone was fine. Like the S4, but faster. And with fingerprints. And a heart rate monitor. The screen was pretty, with a warmer tone than the S4. I wasn't a fan of the 'recents' button instead of a menu button, but I probably would have gotten used to it if I had the chance. I'm not afraid to try new buttons. The sound would get a bit buzzy if you listened to headphones with the big charger plugged in, but that was okay too.",3
Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,4,The phone works well with a few minor scratches and dents but that was detailed in the description.

This review will mostly be about my experience trying to buy one. This is my 5th attempt to get an S5 that was as described. I tried 3 times on ebay, doing my homework on the sellers, but they were all flawed in some way (screen burn-in, screen color partially tinted, GPS not working, etc.). This was my second attempt on Amazon. The first one was obviously a refurb and the fit and finish was off. No way that thing was going to be water resistant. I looked into seller ratings and wanted a ""new"" S5. So far everyone indicated they were new, but they were clearly not. They didnt even have the decency to sell a product that could fool someone to think it was new. This time, I went with TopShelf Direct as my seller and this one is actually new, or darn well close enough to fool me and is functional and clean. No doubt, use these guys if you can.",1
Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,5,"I needed a new phone after my Iphone died on me, and I wanted this model specifically because friends have been raving about it.All the wireless carriers nowadays charging full price for their phones, apparently their old ""eligible for upgrade"" policy means NOTHING anymore.I refuse to pay those crazy prices they charge and started some research on an alternative way to get a new phone.After some Google searches I realized that I can bring in my own phone and have them activate it for free, as long as the phone is compatible with their services.In the description it states this phone is compatible with AT&T so I ordered it, but was just a bit afraid I'd get a refurbished one.The phone I got was brand new and AT&T activated it at no cost!For me personally this phone is even better because it is unlocked, which means that when I travel to Europe I can pop in a local SIM card, and no longer pay the crazy high per minute costs of texting and calling charged by AT&TThink about it, I paid $230-ish for the same phone AT&T would have charged me $507...not a hard choice to make.",0

I was advised to get a new phone rather than having the screen replaced. Although I was sad at the loss (I'll miss you, dear S4), I was also excited that I was obtaining a new phone. I was a loyal Galaxy client because I had been, so far, satisfied with the S3 and S4 I had gotten over the years.When the phone arrived, it seemed to be in good condition, however, I made a discovery that had me regretting having bought this phone... the CAMERA sucks! When I say the camera sucks, I mean it sucks... really bad. Compared with the cameras of the S3 and S4, the quality was not good at all: really grainy images from both front and back cameras with the selfie camera being the worse of the two. No matter how much I tried adjusting the settings, the camera's images did not compare to what I had before. I appreciated the other features/specs but the quality camera I was used to left me so disappointed with this phone I ended up paying a thousand bucks in my currency for that I could not give the phone the 5 stars I would've given its predecessors.Samsung, I am so disappointed in this product (and in wasting my hard earned money on this phone) that I will try the iPhone next (and I prefer Windows to Apple). The 3 stars are to praise the other amenities on the phone",4
Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,1,"Really disappointed. I had the S3 and bought this because I loved the camera and operating system of the S3, and the S5 is supposed to be better with higher spec. However, all the pictures I have taken on this new S5 have been quite blurry. This is highly inconvenient as I was planning on using this for pictures for my travels.The charging port does not work unless the charger is angled in a specific way, and this has been tested with multiple chargers.The heart rate monitor does not work.The phone tells me multiple times to make sure the back case of the phone is attached, when it is and even has a case around it to secure it.The speaker phone has issues where people cannot hear me but apparently has lots of feedback and noise. My temporary phone, a nokia lumia worth $40, did not have that issue.The phone itself is probably great, but this particular Galaxy S5 was not worth $365. Not worth the risk of getting a dud phone. Try another seller.I find myself wishing I had just fixed the cracked screen of my Samsung Galaxy S3 which I bought at Costco.",14

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,5,"I ordered an unlocked AT&T 4g LTE Samsung s5. It was Delivered on time. I was able to follow the tracking. Even though it came through USPS (UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE), the phone got to me in 2 days. No shipping charges nor sales tax, and I'm not a Prime Member either. The phone was in excellent condition, actually it was brand new in a tightly sealed package. The 3.0 charging/syncing cable was included. As well as the charger and ear phones, with extra ear buds to change out or replace lost ones. I have Straight Talk and took my sim card out of my HTC ONE VX and placed it in the s5. Installed the battery, Turned on phone, set up phone, and worked great. Battery was at full charge. Only issue, not having anything to do with the seller, I had to call Straight Talk and get the correct APN settings. I googled the APN settings and everything was correct except a couple of those APN settings. I wasn't able to connect to the internet, unless I had wifi. But after getting the correct APN settings from Straight Talk, I could connect to the internet without any issues. ***If you do have Straight Talk and you need help with the APN settings, it would be best if you called from a different phone. The reason why i say that is because they will not want to help you put in the correct settings. ***The phone has crystal clear videos. No drop calls. Able to hook up to bluetooth devices without any issues. Awesome graphics for games. Waiting for my 128gb sd card to come in to expand the memory. The S6 does not allow you to remove the battery nor add an micro SD card and that us another reason i chise thjs phone. Wife really likes the phone and she is considering getting one as well. I Watched the youtube video on the water test. The guy had the phone in 3 feet of water for an hour and never stopped working. I put my phone in a 5 gallon bucket of water for 15 minutes and nothing happened. Yeah it would have sucked if i messed it up by doing that, but i was confident nothing would happen. you want a phone that you will enjoy, purchase this phone. You want regret it. I first thought about the newest iPhone, but I'm glad I got the s5. I was just dissapointed that I didn't order it sooner.",6

(My previous galaxy S2 ran completely out of charge at the end of the day even without doing any thing, if 4G was on)I turned off both the 4G and wireless, at the end of the day it had 80% charge.

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,2,"This has absolutely nothing to do with the vendor, who shipped the phone, as described, quickly.This is about the phone. The Galaxy S5 is a toy - a gamepad, a multi-media plaything. The interface is childish and the annoying confirmation messages have me pulling out my hair.Before I purchased the S5, I had an HTC One (M7) which I felt was too large to be practical, and gave to my granddaughter. I replaced the HTC with an iPhone that was the perfect size for me and was pleased with it until I recently needed to send text messages to multiple people - and found the only issue with the iPhone was the annoying problem about sending text messages to multiple Android devices.I decided I'd try the Samsung S5 and it was an eye-opener. Where the HTC One was business-like, the Galaxy is toy-like. Where the iPhone was a phone that did other things, the Galaxy is a multimedia toy that can make a low-quality phone call.For whom was this thing designed? Get a text message, red it and finish with it, go to delete it and I have to tap the three-dot sub-menu icon, tap ""DELETE"", select the message(s), tap ""DONE"" and then have to confirm my decision? I had three separate steps to decide whether or not I really, really wanted to dump a text, and still have to tap another gateway? (And there's still an ""Undo"" option at the bottom of the screen).Even Microsoft doesn't demand as many ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" decisions as the Galaxy S5 demands of me. I'm a busy kind of a guy, and this is eating into my productivity.The icons are straight from Nickelodeon and while I'm sure I can search through hundreds, maybe thousands, of alternate screens to download, see above: I'm a busy guy.With a strong cell signal, the calls are not clear - nowhere near the call quality I enjoyed with the HTC and the iPhone.The screen is a grime magnet. I never thought of it before, but since my granddaughter is visiting (with my old HTC) I laid the three phones - HTC, iPhone and Galaxy - side-by-side and the screen on the Galaxy shows every smudge and finger tap and I swear it smudges just by looking at it.It is, however, fast. Not noticeably faster than the HTC, but definitely faster than the iPhone; however, speed never bothered me with any of the phones, so what's the big deal with speed? Games! See above: I'm a busy guy who doesn't have time to waste playing games on what's supposed to be a phone.The Galaxy has a huge fan base and I don't know why. I do understand why this previous generation device costs considerably less than the previous generation models of other cell phones: they aren't toys, this is.I'll probably send it back and get something more for adults.",2

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,5,"An absolutely gorgeous phone. Upgraded from a Motorola E2, I wanted a phone that had a replaceable battery and a larger screen. I was impressed by the Moto, blown away with the Galaxy resolution! I still need to verify that the phone is unlocked, but being an ATT customer, the phone was previously an ATT unit, so a simple slide in of my sim card and I was on the air. I was a little ""let down"", I had thought it would have the last version of Kit Kat, it is Lollipop, not a big fan of the newer ""google-centric"" background data mining. The phone came as indicated, actually in A++++ condition, there was no signs of use/abuse and the screen was flawless.",0

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,1,"So, my phone had some few issues from day one but knowing it was under warranty I kept it. It finally gets to the point I know the problem isn't software and it's hardware. I not only had to purchase a cheap second phone to use just so I could ship it I then get told they won't f'in fix it. Supposedly something came lose and they don't care because as far as they are concerned it's ""Beyond Economical Repair"" . What is ""Beyond Economical Repair""? It's whatever repair Samsung decides it doesn't want to do and jacks up the price to cover themselves. So a phone less than 6 months old is a paperweight.After this experience I will never be buying another Samsung device and would recommend anyone to not do so. There customer service and warranty service is horrible. They even got the color wrong when they had the serial number!To update:1.) It was BER because it was not white. Yet I ordered the Charcoal Black model and the back of the Box w/ the same IMEI as the phone says ""BLACK"".2.) Amazon graciously is allowing me to return it. But this is not Amazon's problem and unfortunately they are having to handle Samsung's bs.3.) My Moto X Pure arrives tomorrow and I will be glad to be no longer using a Samsung device.",0

I had never had either of them available in a store where they were useable and therefore comparable. I ordered it with other products on a Thursday, they all said""order by o'clock and have it Saturday see shipping details. I did pay two day shipping. I believe I received this about 12 days later and it was an AT&T phone. I own a Samsung Tab 10. Love it. Not only is this phone nice. Easy on the eyes, good one handed operation and all the bells and whistles but the appeal for me was to have a device that would sync totally as a system with my tab finally. The phone I was comparing it with had all the same stuff and a lot more. I had decided to keep that one when the galaxy finally showed up. Even though the phone was stuffed with AT&T bloatware I seriously started to consider this phone. In the end even though I really hadn't wanted a large phone, I found it easier and more enjoyable to take advantage of all the bells and whistles with it. With the galaxy it just started looking like this flagships phone little brother. Trying real hard to be big brother but just not mature enough. Lol Dealing with the at&t problem did have a big effect on my decision. I wonder what a truly unlocked galaxy might have done to my decision.",0

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,5,"I was at first skeptical of buying a refurbished phone, but after extensive research, coupled with the seller's sales history and ratings, I decided it should be a safe purchase. The phone works great! Everything was included as advertised. I had some initial trouble getting it on my phone carrier's network, but this issue and the responsibility of the issue is external of Amazon, the seller, or even the phone for that matter. That issue lies solely with the way that carrier locks an IMEI number to a SIM card, which all other carriers do not do. You can usually just swap an existing SIM into a new phone and go (usually with a couple hours before it autoconfigs). Not with MetroPCS.What can I say? The phone is great. The seller (BREED) was awesome and answered all my questions, and even provided options for me to return/refund/RMA/exchange the device while I was having issues getting it connected to the new network. Thankfully I was able to get the issue resolved without having to go that route.",2

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,2,"I would not buy this again. I went from S5 to S5 so I am an expert, and this S5 felt inauthentic. The backing supplied was cheap and cracked along the edges immediately, so I replaced it with the back from my previous. The lights on the front buttons leach into the regular display and cannot be turned off. The charger beeped every 2-3 minutes so had to be replaced. The screen cracked within 30 days and hadn't been dropped. Too good to be true I guess. Next time I will pony up the dough and buy elsewhere. That said, it works. At best it;s a poorly refurbished product, but the ad doesn't say that, and I filtered for new only.",1

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,5,"A wonderful phone! This is by far the best phone I have ever had. It is loaded with a crap ton of features, I'm still trying to learn them after having the phone for a few weeks. It is fast, so far has been able to handle everything I've thrown at it. The camera is fairly good too, 16mp and great 1080p video. It has a smooth motion setting that makes your video incredibly clear and smooth frame rate. So far I am absolutely loving it. The only downside to it is that the battery is kind of weak. My phone is at about 40-50% by the time I get home from work with light use all day. Aside from that one thing, this phone is a great buy for the price I got it.",0
Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,1,"I bought this phone a little over a year ago, and did not leave a review. I was stupid enough to buy it when it was over $400. I had this phone for only 3 months before I dropped it (while it was in a phone protector case from ballistic) and the inner screen shattered. I didn't drop this crap phone from a great hight, it was only like 3 feet. So the repair would have cost $200+ No way in hell I was going to pay another 200+ to fix a 3 month old phone that has a LCD screen so delicate that even in a phone case it can not handle a 3 foot drop. I bought a cheap LG phone as a replacement, know what? That cheap phone doesn't even have a cover, and I have dropped it more times than I can count, it still works. LG for me from now on.",1

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,1,"When I received the new phone I knew this phone was not a new new phone as stated, it had no manual, no headphone earbuds, did not have a workable audio mic and the Flipboard logo was constantly imbedded on the screen.",1
Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,1,"I specifically bought this version of the galaxy (rather than the newer s6) because it claimed to be waterproof. It wasn't. Accidentally dropped it into some water (with all of the ports sealed and the back case on), and now it is dead. I tried to dry it out, but it is still dead. Of course the warranty doesn't cover water damage... even though they market the phone as being protected against just this scenario. I was a loyal Samsung customer, but this is absolutely the last Samsung I will ever buy. I have also become THAT person who rails against Samsung at every opportunity. I will probably get some tee shirts made at the local airbrushing place at the mall with ""Samsung Lies"" printed across them, with a sad, dead, phone, slowly leaking water in the background. I will insist that all members of my family wear these shirts whenever they are in public. The kids will probably be happy with this arrangement, since they wanted iPhones anyway. Maybe I'll hang a bedsheet with ""Don't believe Samsung!"" hastily scrawled on it with dripping shoe polish from my balcony. I'll lose all of my remaining friends (I have no idea how many friends I have left since my calls and texts have gone unanswered for days now), and have to resort to writing craigslist ads for new friends and a new phone, and then I'll probably get murdered. All because I bought this stupid phone. Thanks, Samsung. Thanks for ruining my life.BTW, when it worked (for a month, before it's ""waterproofing"" didn't do it's job) the phone was fine. Like the S4, but faster. And with fingerprints. And a heart rate monitor. The screen was pretty, with a warmer tone than the S4. I wasn't a fan of the 'recents' button instead of a menu button, but I probably would have gotten used to it if I had the chance. I'm not afraid to try new buttons. The sound would get a bit buzzy if you listened to headphones with the big charger plugged in, but that was okay too.",3
Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,4,The phone works well with a few minor scratches and dents but that was detailed in the description. I have been using this for 3 months and there has have been no major issues. I would purchase again but would probably step up to buy a phone in Great condition since on occasion a button will jam.,1

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,1,"Worst Online experience so far.I thought I did an extensive research before my purchase. I guess I didnt. I have had my phone for 6 months only and I regret this purchase.For starters it comes with several at&t apps and widgets that took me a while to know how to uninstall and disable, and they used my battery and my data. (I guess that's just ignorance from my side)Then with a silly fall the screen cracked pretty bad, and replacing it was expensive.The charger got damaged pretty fast, I was surprised by this. It was supposed to be original right?The battery also got damaged and became unusable. I was told this should not happen with this thpe of phone so fast, meaning one thing. The battery was not original. They check my charger and guess what. It was not originall either. The outlet piece should handle 5.3V and it just handles 5.0v which apparently makes a big difference and could have been another reason why the fake battery got ruined fast.Anyways, after this experience I am not buying from this seller and I would probably buy to a company which gives a better warranty (more than a month) if I make an online purchase.",2

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,1,"Contrary to what I was led to believe, this Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900A GSM Unlocked Cellphone is NOT warranted by Samsung if purchased through Amazon. Further, if a repair is required, Samsung will lock the phone for use on AT&T only.Before I bought the phone, I contacted the Amazon seller (Mobile Hotspot) for warranty information. They referred me to Amazon who referred me to the manufacturer. The manufacturer's website states that this model is covered by a one-year manufacturer's warranty. I then ordered it from Amazon. When it stopped working about two weeks after I received it, I contacted Samsung for a warranty repair. Samsung refused to honor the warranty! After many contacts by on-line chat, telephone, and email, I finally escalated the contact to a manager. I learned that the Samsung warranty does not apply to units purchased through Amazon.com. According to the Samsung manager, Amazon is not an authorized Samsung dealer. It does not print the IMEI and Serial Number on the invoice. An invoice from an authorized dealer that shows the date of purchase and identifies the phone with the IMEI and Serial number is required to receive warranty service. The manager agreed to offer a repair as a ""one-time only customer courtesy."" However, if they make the repair, my unlocked phone will be returned to me, no longer unlocked, but locked to enable use on AT&T only. I do not have an AT&T account, so the phone would be useless to me even if it is repaired.This phone may or may not be a good phone when it is working, but I did not have it long enough to find out. It is now on its way back to Amazon, along with the various accessories I also purchased. I will look elsewhere for an unlocked GSM Android phone.",7

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,5,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews on this phone; a lot of complaints. I've not had any problem at all with it, nor have any complaints about it. IVe had it for 2 wks. It's got great reception and is a very fast phone. However, this could always have something to do with your service and area you live in that determines how well that is. Has nothing to do with the actual phone. It has awesome camera quality! It has a lot of ringtones. It has several wallpapers. Short time to fully charge! Slow to lose full charge unlike the iphone I had. With this phone, you can download free music unlike the iPhone I had that went through itunes, which I never used anyway because you have to pay for music. But android phones such as this one probably all come with the option of downloading music for free through Google Play. This phone has already been dropped a few times and no breakage. It even has a different kind of sound if and when it drops; a more thump sound-sturdier unlike the iPhone which is glass and far more fragile. This phone is also very light-weight. My son's phone-like this one, he accidentally dropped out of his second-story window. It didn't break at all. He also accidentally left it in the freezer overnight. Lol It worked fine the next day. This phone also shows a list of all available wifi connections nearby unlike the iPhone I had. This one picks up on wifi nearby all the time which my iphone didn't. Even without the use of wifi uee, the 4G on it works great. It already comes with a screen protector, which was failed to be mentioned in the description. However, I'd bought one anyway not knowing it already came with one. So I'm also using that one. So it can fit two screen protectors if you want. Not necessary of course. But I certainly don't mind. Makes me feel like the phone's screen is even more securely protected. This phone is said to be waterproof. However, I have no use to purposely test that out. Lol I've heard the blood pressure feature doesn't work nor the fingerprint lock screen. I haven't tested either of those out either. Even IF they don't work properly, I still think this is an amazing phone. Besides, those two features aren't really necessary; nice to have I guess. Shouldn't determine how good the phone is overall. I don't regret for a minute buying this phone. I love it!",2

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,2,"BEWARE WHEN BUYING FROM THIS SELLER!!!!! The phone works fine, however I so discovered the phone was not ""new"" as I purchased. The screen had been replaced. I figured this out as the screen stopped turning on and pressing near the home button would cause the phone to reset. I took it in for a diagnostic today and it turns out the team there said the screen wasn't adhered properly as the factory would do, so just normal everyday bumps over time caused the connecting ribbon to short circuit, causing the resets and eventual failure of the screen. My advice, look elsewhere when buying.",2
Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,4,"I am super happy that I got the Samsung S5. I got it about 1 month ago from SCE Enterprise.I picked it for its camera, and I have been continuously impressed at the resolution. The system provides various special features, e.g. video stabilization, burst shots, face detection, and then the usual, white balance, ISO, exposure value. The front facing camera is useful, good enough to skype.The processor is fast, turning it on and off takes about 30 seconds. I downloaded ~25 apps, and it runs fine.The speakers are not very loud, not enough for me to sing along during a shower.The charging portal is not a conventional one, which is unpleasant because I need to buy several more. And if I forget one when I am away from home, my friends won't have extras.The battery life is pretty low, maybe 1 percentage decrease per 1.5 minutes. If I am watching something 3 hours straight, it would be dead. Overnight, it goes down about 12 % just on standby. The battery is a regular Samsung battery.I am on an AT&T plan, and the phone adjusted smoothly. I had to go to the store to exchange for a smaller SIM card, which took about 30 minutes. The only bump was when my data didn't work due to an old APN. So, I added a new one for ATT and it works fine now.Overall, I am super pleased.",2

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,4,"It's Original! Bought this as new. I was worried, with all the comments about ordering new and getting remanufactured or worse a clone from various vendors. First thing I did before even loading SIM card was to install application ""Phone Info - Samsung"" from Play Store to verify was new/original - it was. Item was promptly shipped and arrived in good shape.As for phone itself. It is unlocked (using Consumer Cellular) but is loaded with ATT screen logo and apps plus tied to ATT store. You will want to use the ATT store to immediately upgrade the phone to Android 5.1.1. The phone does not come with a user manual or any other documentation. You will want to go to Samsung website to get the S5 user manual for Android 5.1.1 and to register the phone. The manuals on ATT are not up to date.This is not the S5 Active version but is supposed to be waterproof. I might trust if getting damp in rainstorm but do not expect it to survive drop in toilet or other water hazard. One thing that does annoy me is the screen does not rotate 180 degrees for applications. This makes it impossible to put on stand in portrait mode when plugged into charger. Even worse is the screen does not rotate at all for any home screen and many applications. I am surprised at this as I have the 8in Samsung Tab 3 and this is not an issue. For some reason, for many apps, the phone does not hold settings when a application is updated. After every update cycle I have to check SD Card under Application management to move apps back onto SD Card. That and default apps can be reset and/or removed from home screens.I purchased the S5 instead of the S6 because you can replace batteries and insert an optional SD memory card. The S6 no longer has these features. All though the S5 is noted for long battery life, you will want a spare. With a fully charged battery I started a one hour Skype call. After the Skype call I was down to 48%. I haven't yet played multi-hour video but suspect you may want to stay plugged in or have spare battery ready.",4

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222,4,"So far, so good. I hesitate to give five stars, simply because I've only had this phone for a week. My primary concern with this kind of purchase, as is demonstrated in some reviews with such products, is whether this previous generation of smartphone is truly new and authentic. Once the newest and hottest smartphone version hits the market, any remaining new stock of the previous version is discontinued or swiped up fast (particularly if the previous version is better than the newest). As anyone who has been looking for these models can attest, a lot of the options are refurbished, open-box, unlocked, or most importantly claimed as new but not really. Then you have the issue with whether the model is ""international"", GSM or something else that might prevent it from doing what the buyer wants it to do.So, I'm happy that I found this at a reasonable price and from a seller that I was able to research and develop some confidence in. I was also able to rely on the Amazon return policy in case things didn't work out. BlutekUSA is the seller, in my case, and I have been quite happy with the result. I believe the phone is indeed new, and perhaps even factory-unlocked versus the seller doing it. And it is the real deal, with all the standard, original accessories included.The phone itself works quite well, compared to my Galaxy S3. I have T-Mobile, and this is an AT&T unlocked phone (that's what the ""A"" means, in the G900A model), but I was able to simply take my SIM out of my old phone and insert it into the new phone, do some manual setting of the 4G ling so that I could highlight and pick T-Mobile (more networks, mobile networks, APN setting to T-Mobile), and everything works fine. The performance is improved. The battery is stronger, longer lasting and recharges much faster than the Galaxy S3. It was already updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop, and while not a rooted device, I'm satisfied with the operation.",2

GreatCall Samsung Jitterbug Touch3 Senior Smartphone with 1-Touch Medical Alert and Large Display,Samsung,149.99,1,"On the surface it looks great, meant for senior citizens, etc. In actuality there are a few flaws in the execution of the design.As many have pointed out, the volume will not go up very high. Many seniors have difficulty hearing and my mother could not hear it ""ring"" with any of the offered tones. I was able to solve that by downloading other ring tones using Zedge that had better volume than those offered with this phone.The case is totally black (looks gray in photo) and the keys on the bottom to go back, etc are very small & virtually impossible to see if you have impaired vision.The phone is very small and is clumsy for hands with arthritisNo hard or gel case available for protection, only those pouches. If you have arthritic hands it is difficult to get it out of the pouch to answer a call before it stops ringing. Those cases do not offer much protection and no other case will fit on the phones.The 5Star is there for emergency assistance, however, if you fall & have it in your hand chances are it's gonna break when you fall or you may be so injured that you cannot get it out of the pouch to push that button. I realize that it will dial automatically IF it senses a fall, I presume that only works if you do have it in your hand and it doesn't break in the fall.I wish I had been able to see and examine it before my mother bought it, very disappointed in the overall design. I think she regrets the purchase also.If you are a senior and want a ""smart phone"" there are better options & you can get 5Star without it. I would not recommend this to anyone.",33

GreatCall Samsung Jitterbug Touch3 Senior Smartphone with 1-Touch Medical Alert and Large Display,Samsung,149.99,1,I am very disappointed with this phone. While the phone may be okay no one mentioned that the network they use is Verizon. I cannot get Verizon service at my house. We live in a Verizon and AT&T dead zone. Also this phone does not have a removable SIM card so everything I have on this phone will be lost when I get rid of it. (And I will get rid of it.) Some of the information is important. I had a very difficult time getting this phone set up to use. It took several phone calls with the Great Call people and I don't think it should have been such a problem. I should have known that the good price I paid had some kind of strings attached. Think twice before getting involved with the Jitterbug phones. Make sure you can get Verizon service.,23

GreatCall Samsung Jitterbug Touch3 Senior Smartphone with 1-Touch Medical Alert and Large Display,Samsung,149.99,1,"Purchased this for an 84yr old grandmother, this phone comes with a huge pink 5-star icon button on the home screen. When this button is pressed, whether you are subscribed to the service or not, when the pink 5-star button is pressed the next page has a huge red ""Call 911"" icon button at the bottom located directly above the home button. There is no way to deactivate the button. I was nervous that my grandmother would accidently hit the pink 5 star button and then realize she was in the wrong place and accidently just hit the huge red call 911 button while trying to hit the home button to escape. This phone would have been great if we could have deactivated that button or at least the call 911 button. I just felt that she would have kept accidently hitting that 911 button. When I called Greatcall and added them about accidentally hitting the huge 911 button...

GreatCall Samsung Jitterbug Touch3 Senior Smartphone with 1-Touch Medical Alert and Large Display,Samsung,149.99,1,"I should have read the fine print. Charges have to be auto withdrawal from my account. I don't allow any company to automatically withdraw funds from my checking. I will getting a new phone from another company where I can pay my own bill. In addition there is an activation fee. The next week the funds were taken out for the month's services. Again I should have read the fine print. I was not expecting to pay $80.00 just to get started. Also they automatically put you on the most expensive plan. I thought this was a phone for senior citizens. Why would any senior send 2,000 texts per month?. I called and requested they lower my plan. Also apps are on the phone AND ACTIVATED which was driving up the cost. I thought you could activate the apps you wanted. I explained when I first called that I only needed a phone to send pictures to email. I text about 20 texts, if that, a month. I don't talk a lot. My family and friends communicate through computer more than phones. This phone is also VERY SENSITIVE. Just touch it or lay it down and something is activated. Also, you ""swipe"" to answer a call. However, it does not always work. You have to lay it on a flat service. I use the pen they provided. Using your fingers does not always work. I've had the phone a couple of weeks and am stressed out.

DO NOT activate the voice prompts option or you will tear your hair out trying to get your phone to work again. I think that with all things considered I could have just as well got a recon any type of smart phone from tracfone at a much greater savings. The simplified senior layout isn't really all that simple. This phone will work with tracfone service but you have to call them and insist on speaking to a supervisor. I do not like the idea of paying every month for jitterbug service. So my recommendationb is to pass on this and get a recon from tracfone instead.,1

GreatCall Samsung Jitterbug Touch3 Senior Smartphone with 1-Touch Medical Alert and Large Display,Samsung,149.99,5,"I am no a senior but I need the great call service because I have heart issues. I had the basic flip phone and it broke and being used to Android I found it too basic for me. So I purchased the smartphone so I could have the usual android experience. I used the advanced home screen but this phone also has a basic straight forward screen if you are new to smartphones. I transferred my service and like always the great call peeps were friendly and helpful and helped me get activated rather painlessly. The phone seems pretty good for 150 bucks and has a decent amount of memory for apps. The calling plans are very flexible and economical depending on how much you plan to use the phone. The coverage is good even in the country. The phone works well and shipping was fast thanks to Amazon prime. I think this would make a great first smartphone for seniors and the great call service is in my humble opinion so much better and more flexible than the I've fallen and can't get up button. The only downside is the lack of accessories, specifically screen protectors for it.",77

GreatCall Samsung Jitterbug Touch3 Senior Smartphone with 1-Touch Medical Alert and Large Display,Samsung,149.99,5,"Admittedly I am what is nowadays considered to be an ""old dinosaur"" I guess. I have for years been very reluctant to get any type of cell phone and especially a ""smart phone"" mainly because I wasn't smart enough or ""tech-savvy"" enough to know how to use one properly. When you consider the facts that I grew up in the days of a ""party line"" phone in my parents house as a kid, and even when I gave service as a Vietnam Veteran we all went through compass & map reading classes before the advent of G.P.S. systems---I just was not very receptive to the whole concept of using a portable telephone. But thanks to this Samsung Jitterbug Touch 3 - ""senior citizen"" - (I dislike this term also...) phone and the outstanding customer service people at GreatCall, I actually have learned to like and use this phone very much now. It is a high-quality smart phone but does not make me feel ignorant when using it because it's so simple to operate. Also the extra added advantage of having emergency medical help available and the assistance from the GreatCall folks 24/7 is so reassuring to have. The very kind folks at GreatCall were so extremely patient with my ignorance and took the extra time to help me out anytime that I needed it and carefully explained everything that I wasn't up to speed on. They even credited my account when I did not realize initially that I could use my home WI-FI for internet usage on the phone as well. I would personally highly recommend this phone and the super service from GreatCall for anybody that is from my era or ""cell phone reluctant"" folks such as myself.",6

I have never been able to use the phone more than making 2 trial phone numbers.It is important to mention that Great Call's customer service is abysmally poor.

I switched toGreat Call Customer Service because using Great Call phone was not permitted with the previous company.I purchased the phone from Amazon with the intention of inspecting it and when my phone contract came to an end I would then have myprevious number transferred over to Great Call. This situation was explained to the 5 persons at Great Call Customer Service.Inspite of the aforementioned, I received 3 bills from Great Call's Customer Service with the threat of Collection Activity. I had also been toldthat I was given a Port phone number which was definitely not the case. There is a big difference between area code 561 and 954. Had I beenasked to use a phone number with area code 561 there is no question I would have refused to do so, as my contact with ATT had not come toan end.

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,2,It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it.

To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page.,0
Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,4,"If your looking to purchase then you know about IPHONES, except for the color, which i'am not crazy about the phone came without any visible wear or operational issues appears like new.For the price i'll put up with the color. Couple of details: the phone does not come with a charger only the cable, chargers are cheap at amazon, the other is that while this a Verizon phone I went to Cricket, they are owned by AT&T so they use their towers and got 2.5 GB of data and unlimited voice and text for 35 bucks with auto pay, AT&T is not Verizon but its good enough for me. They will insert their sim card and its ready to go.",0
Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,4,"I bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn't come with a new SIM card so I had to buy a kit. That was my only qualm with this phone. The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option.",0

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,3,"The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone. Big bummer",0

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,1,If I talk on the phone for more than 10 minutes it dies then sometimes it dies even if I'm not using it..sometimes it can have 95% and it will die...The only reason why I haven't sent it back yet is due to the fact that my job requires me to have a phone so going even two days without it will disturb my job...so all day it stays on the charger even if I'm at work if I'm sleeping when I'm in the car if I talk more than two minutes it has to be on the charge so it won't die...physically the phone it looks great as described no broken screen no cracks is just the battery....then when I emailed I was told it can take four weeks or longer to get a refund,6

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,2,"This may seem really ridiculous but I ordered this last week and got it Saturday. Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers. Lol.",0

Totally pissed and disappointed this is total bulls*** that i paid almost $200 just to have to return it and not to mention the sadness of my child that I am returning her birthday gift, and now have to wait to send this one back..... get credit...... order another...... wait for it to come in.....Waste of time and money.",1

It refused to even power up and got stuck on the Apple logo screen. I tried several different ways of resolving the problem myself over the course of several hours and nothing worked. After contacting Apple, I was told that we had exhausted all the options and that there was a hardware problem with the phone. Never even got it turned on. Very disappointing- I had very high hopes.

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,5,"I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough.",2

I am a major clutz and have dropped my phone on the daily since I received it, but as it's been in the case during those drops it has sustained only one major screen shatter- when it dropped out of my pocket from two stories above ground.If you are familiar with apple, and want a reliable phone that is an older model, this is the way to go.

Not only that but the phone came very clean and absolutely NO cracks or even scratches. It looked brand new and the speed on the phone is outstanding, battery life lasts all day I would find myself charging my phone only twice a day if I was on it from morning to before I went to bed.

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,1,"Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.",9

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,5,"Purchased from Bobcat Wireless and received a great Refurbished phone. Came in generic packaging, but had an Apple charger. Setup was tricky at Verizon but the dude got it done. This phone is basically an iphone 5 in Color...which is what the C stands for. It does not have Fingerprint Sensor or some of the added camera specs of the 5s, but for normal, daytime pix, this phone is great. The exterior is a tough plastic exterior around aluminum. The size is nice. If you are like me and can't stand the thought of holding a tablet to your ear, you will like the size and feel of this phone. The color is great. I bought this for my son, but honestly, I had a hard time handing it over. The green phone is a tad lighter than standard Minecraft green. Fellow geeks will understand. I went with 32GB. I don't recommend going with anything less unless you have the restraint to use only a handful of apps. I wish this phone had offered the 64GB option. This phone is fast. It moves seamlessly from songs to apps, etc. Apparently you have to set Siri up on this phone. I'll deal with that another day. But, very satisfied with this seller and phone. The phone did work with Verizon, although unlocked. And, the iCloud and iTunes information from the previous owner was completely deleted.",0

I'm not a high tech person and tried to live with it...ended up being so frustrated I turned it off and filed claim. However claim was a few days past 30 day guarantee and GizmoTraders wouldn't exchange it. SHAME ON AMAZON TOO because they advertised 90 day A to Z guarantee on this product which of course led me to believe they would guarantee a good resolution for problems of defective merchandise but that was not the case!

It is from Verizon but it's factory unlocked- worked great with a T-Mobile SIM card and a Cricket SIM card (both got LTE).It got here in only 3 days or so (ordered Sunday night arrived Wednesday). The condition is much better than I imagined! Personally, I would list this phone as Excellent or mint. It's perfect except for one tiny scratch near the power button.The screen is in PERFECT condition with no scratches. I put a TechArmor glass screen protector on it and also an Otterbox Commuter.It came with a charger and sync cable which work as they should.The phone came with iOS 8.1.1 which was perfect for jailbreaking.Clean IMEI, no iCloud lock.",0

I was so bummed... Even though I am a long-time Verizon customer (10 years now), I decided to keep the phone and just try AT&Ts service for a little while - oh my, what a BIG MISTAKE. To make a long, very negative story short and sweet, I ended up buying a VERIZON iPhone just like this one (blue, too) and IMMEDIATELY took my service back to Verizon; they only charge me $45 a month without a contract anyway. BUT... when my bill came from AT&T (only 3 weeks into my new service), they wanted almost $67 from me after telling me it would only be $45 from the beginning!!!! - HA - I'm not stupid and I refuse to be lied to, so that's why I changed back to Verizon with the same type of phone - because both Verizon and the PHONE rock!",0

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,2,"The standing joke about the Apple iPhone 5c is that the ""c"" stands for ""cheap,"" not ""color."" The phone came with a sim card that you'll have to take to the Verizon store to activate. It also comes with a SIM port key, earbuds, a charger and the fun standard Apple icon stickers. I chose to purchase the green one, which was a fun spring green! It took two weeks to arrive at my doorstep, but the product booted just fine and worked for about a month. The processing is much faster than the iPhone 4, but in comparison to my mom's iPhone 6, it might just be worth waiting for the next iPhone to come out in the next couple of months. The ear piece stopped working after 32 days. I returned to the seller for a refund, but they charged me a 50% restocking fee.

Since I knew the people well at my local Verizon store, I finally convinced them to insure it. But now it won't hold the iCloud password: it is either an internal phone problem or an Apple problem. I'm probably going to trade this in for a Samsung. This was my first Apple purchase and I am very disappointed. You may save a few bucks by buying online, but you will be better off in the long-run by buying local where the seller will stand behind their product.",6

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,1,"It is an unlocked phone and I can take it to any carrier. However, BEWARE. It's a dud phone. So sensitive, it goes into Mute, Speaker or FaceTime when I am on all calls. When business Conference calls mute me as I am communicating, disconnects as I am receiving important information, I am losing valuable time (read money) getting back on track of a conversation with my refurbished iPhone. *Sigh Then 3 weeks after that, my cell phone does not ring for calls nor dings for msgs.

I gave it three stars because of everything else.It comes with headphones, a wall charger and cable, but they were all different brands. The wall charger was some off brand, the cable was belkin but what was weird is that the headphones were really nice, dreys beats, the kind that go IN your ear, but they were used (gross).",2

I contacted verizon and they told me the serial number was not a real phone so what is it?? Ridiculous. Second. It charged one time. And did not charge agian. The phone would not take a charge. It said charging, but the battery just went down. Better get a refund.",11

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,1,"I do not believe I was shipped an Apple product. The rep at the Verizon store could not register the phone on the Verizon system. After closer inspection, he felt that it was a knock-off. I agree as the home button was not correct and was off center and the body of the phone had pulled away from the screen on one end. So far I have spent over 2 hours dealing with this phone. I did process a return for a refund and will purchase another 5C from a different supplier.",4

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,2,It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page.,0
Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,4,"If your looking to purchase then you know about IPHONES, except for the color, which i'am not crazy about the phone came without any visible wear or operational issues appears like new.For the price i'll put up with the color. Couple of details: the phone does not come with a charger only the cable, chargers are cheap at amazon, the other is that while this a Verizon phone I went to Cricket, they are owned by AT&T so they use their towers and got 2.5 GB of data and unlimited voice and text for 35 bucks with auto pay, AT&T is not Verizon but its good enough for me. They will insert their sim card and its ready to go.",0
Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,4,"I bought this phone originally for myself and the phone itself it great but it didn't come with a new SIM card so I had to buy a kit. That was my only qualm with this phone. The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option.",0

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,3,"The case was more beat up than expected. We had to remove the screen and unplug and re-plug the 3 screen connections several times to get it to respond consistently, but other than that it's an iPhone and seems to work; now the screen is failing more often and it is past the 30 day warranty, we will likely need to replace it or the phone.

They were right, the back had a few scratches, but nothing that my Otterbox would not cover over anyways! :) The screen was perfect, not one scratch on it! I am NOT a technology person, and I didn't understand the ""No SIM card"" thing. I had no clue that it was a needed thing for my phone. However, I took my phone to Verizon to get it activated and they just gave me one, no problem, no charge. It was simple.THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for the great service and the phone.

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Green,Apple,33,5,"This is the version of the iphone you want if you are an international traveler from the states. Either the iPhone 5, 5c, or 5S; if you don't get the factory unlocked version online, then buy the Verizon Wireless version only. Unlike AT&T and Sprint (DO NOT buy the Sprint model, they don't support enough LTE bands for international travel) Verizon sells their phones unlocked. With AT&T you have to go through a lot of red tape just to get it unlocked; not cool. If you decided to buy directly from a Verzion store, just buy the phone without a contract and go with a month-to-month plan. People think they are getting a deal on the phone by getting the 2-year contract, but in the long run, you will be spending WAAAYYY more than if you would just spend the money for the phone out right and go with a prepaid plan. You'll save a lot more money that way. Spend $500 now and have the freedom to go with any phone company you want, or spend about $2000 for the next two years? The choice is yours... >:D",72

Before I got it activated the other night the screen was messing up on me. I was having a lot of fun trying to put in my WiFi information. Anyway, I got it activated last night and everything was working fine. But now it's back to the way it was before it was activated. The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully. If not, it's either just not meant for me, I got a lemon, or I should just curse the fact that I have big fingers. Lol.",0

I'm probably going to trade this in for a Samsung. This was my first Apple purchase and I am very disappointed.

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White,Apple,139.95,5,"I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough.",2

I am a major clutz and have dropped my phone on the daily since I received it, but as it's been in the case during those drops it has sustained only one major screen shatter- when it dropped out of my pocket from two stories above ground.If you are familiar with apple, and want a reliable phone that is an older model, this is the way to go.

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White,Apple,139.95,5,"Purchased from Bobcat Wireless and received a great Refurbished phone. Came in generic packaging, but had an Apple charger. Setup was tricky at Verizon but the dude got it done. This phone is basically an iphone 5 in Color...which is what the C stands for. It does not have Fingerprint Sensor or some of the added camera specs of the 5s, but for normal, daytime pix, this phone is great. The exterior is a tough plastic exterior around aluminum. The size is nice. If you are like me and can't stand the thought of holding a tablet to your ear, you will like the size and feel of this phone. The color is great. I bought this for my son, but honestly, I had a hard time handing it over. The green phone is a tad lighter than standard Minecraft green. Fellow geeks will understand. I went with 32GB. I don't recommend going with anything less unless you have the restraint to use only a handful of apps. I wish this phone had offered the 64GB option. This phone is fast. It moves seamlessly from songs to apps, etc. Apparently you have to set Siri up on this phone. I'll deal with that another day. But, very satisfied with this seller and phone.

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White,Apple,139.95,1,"Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.",9

The color is cute and the size is perfect; I love the new chargers, I got this phone after having an iPhone 4 and the charger was always breaking on me so this was a nice change. As paranoid as I am about dropping iPhones ( since I had a iPhone 4) I did drop this a few times before I could get a case and was pleasantly surprised that the screen held up! One thing I dislike about Apple products is the headphones, they are way too big for my ears and don't have good connectivity so I never use them and I feel as if they're going to waste! I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well! She found some of the apps to be too much but after she got the hang of how everything worked she really enjoyed it. She very much loves to use the FaceTime option.",0

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White,Apple,139.95,5,"I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough.",2

To make a long, very negative story short and sweet, I ended up buying a VERIZON iPhone just like this one (blue, too) and IMMEDIATELY took my service back to Verizon; they only charge me $45 a month without a contract anyway. BUT... when my bill came from AT&T (only 3 weeks into my new service), they wanted almost $67 from me after telling me it would only be $45 from the beginning!!!! - HA - I'm not stupid and I refuse to be lied to, so that's why I changed back to Verizon with the same type of phone - because both Verizon and the PHONE rock!",0

I chose to purchase the green one, which was a fun spring green! It took two weeks to arrive at my doorstep, but the product booted just fine and worked for about a month. The processing is much faster than the iPhone 4, but in comparison to my mom's iPhone 6, it might just be worth waiting for the next iPhone to come out in the next couple of months.

"Apple A1533 Unlocked iPhone 5S Smart Phone, 16 GB (White)",Apple,115,1,Don't waste your time .buy from the Apple Store.When I got mine the battery life was very poor 2 hours usage 6 hours standby with no added apps and all the standard settings for battery life. After researching the problem and tryin everything it was clearly a bad battery.I paid to return it and the seller emailed me to say a replacement was sent. When I received the replacement clearly it was the same phone as I had forgotten to remove the screen protector. What's worse. The battery life now was less than 1hoir usage straight out of the box after full 7hr recharge from the wall adapter and no added apps.So I decided rather than waste any more money shipping back to this incompetent repair center I'd just buy the battery replace kit and do it myself!wish I'd spent the little extra to get at the Apple Store now.,5

It gets 5 stars for the fact that its exactly as advertised works for T-mobile and my wife tolerates it. I'm telling her to F off next time she wants another Iphone though.,1

The only thing which was odd, was that when I checked for Apple warranty online they told me that the warranty was expired and the phone was produced more than 2 years ago. Customer service guaranteed me that still the phone was new and not refurbished and I was sticking with that, as really everything else seemed like new.Another small thing which is odd: this phone has Chinese preinstalled as language in all apps and many sub menus. Although changing the primary language to English it was not possible to remove Chinese completely as a language. I tried to get around that by installing Spanish as a second language so Chinese is now only third. Nevertheless Chinese signs keep popping up from time to time on the phone.",4

After researching the problem and tryin everything it was clearly a bad battery.I paid to return it and the seller emailed me to say a replacement was sent. When I received the replacement clearly it was the same phone as I had forgotten to remove the screen protector. What's worse. The battery life now was less than 1hoir usage straight out of the box after full 7hr recharge from the wall adapter and no added apps.So I decided rather than waste any more money shipping back to this incompetent repair center I'd just buy the battery replace kit and do it myself!wish I'd spent the little extra to get at the Apple Store now.,5

Admittedly the phone does occasionally freeze. The battery does not last long unless you get a power management app, and the phone does get rediculously hot when charging the phone, using the GPS or any combination of the two. However I've found that shutting the phone off at night and turning it on in the morning helps to alleviate the freezing problem. Also if you can't shut it off all night, shut it down for 5 - 10 minutes int the mornning. Other than that the phone is awesome!!! lightning fast! Faster than some of the newer phones coming out now. Internet is blazing fast as well as app downloads. the screen resolution is outstanding as is the sound quality, WIFI, and Tethering (you can wirelesslly tether to your laptop or simply use the phone as a wifi hotspot(*best option). Laptop will operate at normal wifi speeds) All in all the phone is much better than some of it successors and will hang with most android phones on the market today.

I had the LG google G2X for almost 5 months, and I do not recommend it for several reasons:1- The camera is not good enough as I expect from 8 MP camera (the 5 MP on the Galaxy is much better), although the video camera is not bad if the light was enough.2- After you dial the number and get connected, it is very hard to dial an extention number because the touch sreen kind of freezes even though I tried to change the settings not do so. The technology behind that is for you not to dial more number by accident by touching the screen. If you are dialing international number using a phone card that will be very frustrating sometimes. I contacted the seller from the biggining but he wanted to charge me a lot of return fees and shipping fees, so I kept the phone and I thought may be I will learn how to deal with it. I would like to mention that I am very comfortable dealing with the new gadgets and technologies.3- Does not support a lot of languages at least to read web pages on the net ( for example I can't read an email was written in Arabic or an arabic web page on facebook).4- A little bit heavy comparing to others. But maybe feels sturdy.5- If you buy from amazon.com the best thing to do is to buy items are sold by Amazon only. Their return polocy is excellent especially if you are Prime member. A lot of other sellers have shipping time much longer, and the return polocies will push you to change your mind to return it because it will cost you a lot, just like what happened to me with the seller Wissamelectric which I will never buy from him again. He tried to discourage me not to send the phone back by putting all these fees.Of course the phone has a lot of good features as smart phone but all listed in the description. Over all I won't buy it again or recommend it for a friend.",1

Will buy the same phone from the same seller again.The phone is a DUAL CORE phone (two chips), so EVERYTHING is processed faster. I have had a Quad Core computer for almost four years, and it still beats everything out there, so having more chips speeds up anything. 2012 will be the year of Dual Core phones, so this was slightly ahead of its time/future competitors. I chose this over a Nexus S and a Galaxy S II (all three unlocked) because this phone will do 98% of what those two phones will do at about 60% of the price!!! Great value for your budget.Tip: Get an unlimited data plan for this phone (from your phone carrier). It will soak up anything (data-wise) you can throw at it...already downloaded 400 megs in a day and a half of initial usage! And not one lockup or slowdown! Came with Android 2.3.3, so very happy with the software side of things...Battery: Get a bigger battery folks..this phone uses up battery power like you won't believe (on the standard battery). When you open the box, CHARGE it first for a few hours (overnight?), only then use it..then let the battery discharge all the way down to ZERO before you recharge it again...apparently these batteries need to be fully charged and fully discharged (the first 5-10 times) before they will accomplish their full range. The bigger battery (had to buy it seperately) charged up fine in the car from the cig lighter (3 hours). Turn the GPS off to save battery power. Already has a battery app on board, so you don't need another battery app.Phone: VERY easy to use, big large buttons. Hangup button is red (center button on screen) or you can configure the Power button to be the hangup button. MAKE SURE you turn OFF the mobile hotspot button otherwise you will be burning through your data plan. It defaults to ON when the phone turns on the first time (at least in mine).Texting: Easy to use buttons (on screen)..although the one complaint i have (andriod software) is that it constantly corrects names or words it doesn't recognise..you have to press the word that is all the way on the left side to let the word stay in the sentence/text (the one you just typed). On the other hand, it DOES suggest words as you are typing, so you don't always have to type the whole word.Internet/Data: You will be addicted to the speed of this phone! Enjoy!!!User Manual (in box). Good pictures etc, but i found the online manual MUCH more informative.Overall: GREAT PHONE for the price. Equals or beats most of the high dollar whiz bang phones out on the market now (Jan 2012) at about 60% of the price. Will be buying the 2nd one shortly (same seller).",7

The primary features of the phone are as follow:Super fast due to the Tegra 2 SoC which is a dual ARM Cortex A9 CPU with an Nvidia GeForce ULP GPUScreen is very clear and bright with vivid coloursFeatures an 8MP camera that takes good quality pictures compared to other phone camerasSupports 1080p video recording and playbackDecent battery life (with moderate use, it easily lasts me a full day)The reason I give it a 4 star rating is because I did have some troubles with the Wifi connection flaking out. When I first set it up, it worked fine but then after some time it just couldn't reach any servers, despite Wifi being connected. After playing around with it a bit, I found a solution by disabling the mobile data connection (not sure if this is truly necessary) and configuring the Wifi settings using a static IP and manually setting the default gateway, subnet mask and DNS. It seems that when using DHCP over Wifi, the G2x doesn't use the router assigned DNS and therefore cannot connect to any servers unless you type in the actual IP address. I don't know if this is because of a software bug or if it's my, admittedly cheap, router's fault. Something to keep in mind if you have this particular issue.As far as the other problems I've read about, I haven't experienced any of them. No light bleed from the screen and no random reboots. I read somewhere that Cyanogenmod actually fixes the reboot problem on affected phones so that might be something to try if you are having that issue.Overall I am very happy with the G2x.

I will never buy anything again in my life from Amazon, i will make sure my family and friends wouldn't buy from Amazon again, there are so many online retailers in this country.

There are a few caveats.1. The branded T-Mobile version of this phone doesn't work at all even if unlocked. The rom will reset the APN back to the default T-Mobile APN as soon as you exit and save it. It's a firmware issue.I use mine on NET10 and you have to select T-Mobile as the carrier to get 4G. You also have to set up a custom APN per NET10 instructions. I'm sure similar steps will be necessary for other carriers.2. If you intend to websurf, play hi-def 3D games, stream movies, or shoot videos you will definitely need to purchase additional batteries. I use an EZO 3500 w/cover and can play about 8-10 hrs.3. Load the LG support tool on your PC and update the product.Awesome phone for the price. Don't drop it ;-)",0

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,4,Phone worked great during short international travel. Very easy to use. Was already set up in English when it arrived. Just put in the SIM card and everything worked as intended.,0
LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,4,"When reading about the LG-A275, I noticed two screen variants. One screen has ""1"" and ""2"" with a bit of Spanish on the screen, and the other screen has a purple flower with some English. I picked the vendor who displayed the flower with English. My choice paid off because my LG-A275 was preset to English. The included manual was in French, Portuguese and English. Some random observations as I have used the phone:** The LG-A275 was simple to program, a lot like two Motorolas I had.** The manual says that only 2G SIM cards are supported.** The phone is light and a bit small for my size 7-1/2 hand.** The radio has 10 presets and the autoscan function works very well. Reception was surprisingly good and no SIM card is required for the radio.** There is a headset jack but no bluetooth.** The torch/flashlight function is buried under tools, so you will not be accidentally using it.** The power cord has a European plug and a US adapter. Otherwise, it looks like the adapter for my LG800 phone and has the same specs.** The on/off button does not work in power save mode, and it only works when the screen is unlocked.** If you leave the LG-A275 at the home screen, the device locks itself after 10, 30 or 60 seconds (your choice). It unlocks with a combination of 3 keys -- any key for screen on, left for unlock, and right for Yes. The keys take a bit of pressure, so it should not randomly dial from a pocket.** BEWARE: If you leave the phone in ANY menu mode (radio, contacts, messaging, etc.), the screen goes dark but the phone does not lock!Al in all, it seems like a good option for the car while traveling in Europe.",2

Battery lasts AGES which is I bet the #1 reason people buy this phone, also Quad-Band GSM is great for the rest of the civilised world that has moved on from / never bothered with CDMA (i.e. will not work in US on Verizon or Sprint.)Here's the one gripe about this phone: yes it has two SIM slots. But unlike some other dual-SIM phones where the SIM receptacle can hinge outwards, enabling easy swap-out, the two SIM holders are flush against the body of the phone (under the battery) and can be a tricky squeeze for SIMs using adapters (say, your nanoSIM from your iPhone).

One for me and one for a friend.

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,5,I chose this phone because I travel abroad so that I can use it with a foreign sim card and make and receive calls all over the world cheap.

The phone is not expensive at all. I love my phone as it comes with super flash light you use when dark and it retains charge for days.

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,2,"It's exactly what I was looking for: a small, super-simple phone to use for international travel as well as for an extra local phone for the family. The dual SIM card feature is a nice bonus for foreign travel. I love the fact that it has almost no features... as long as I can throw a SIM card in it and make a call, that's all I want.Problem is, it didn't even work as a basic phone. I could send and receive calls, but it arrived new in the box with a speaker which was completely dead. It would vibrate, but not ring. I couldn't hear anything from the person at the other end, but they could hear me. I downloaded and read the manual, and went through all of the volume settings, but no luck.Since I couldn't actually hear anything, I can't report on sound quality, but from a test call, I was told that my voice came through clearly on the other end as long as I spoke directly into the mouthpiece. But it's a tiny little phone, and if I held it up to my ear, the person on the other end couldn't clearly hear me, and said my voice kept dropping out. Since the mouthpiece only came down to my cheek, I think holding a real conversation might be difficult.No problem getting a cell signal, or sending/receiving calls, using an AT&T SIM card from my home (where we have a strong signal).There's a built-in FM radio, which also didn't work. When I plugged in headphones, I could hear the FM static just fine, but no stations. I don't really care about getting radio from a phone, but when it doesn't pick up any signals near a major city... that's a problem.I really wish this little phone worked, and I still may try again, but I'm not optimistic.",2

Return was authorized, but I was required to print out mailing label for return. i have no printer and do not want one (another piece of technology that usually doesn't work), so Amazon suggested I get a friend or relative to print out the label or use a library printer - in other words, i should bear the inconvenience of Amazon's failure to provide relevant information. I went to the library to print out the label and only then realized that I am required to pay postage for the return. So now I'm supposed to go to the Post Office during the Christmas rush and get this thing weighed. I may or may not bother. This amount is not going to break me and I have already purchased a phone (through another website) that I know is intended for the English-speaking population.",8

This was way more than we needed, but it was one of the cheapest packages they offered. The phone worked perfectly with no difficulties concerning anything.

Eventually you get used to it, and start to enjoy the abuse in a masochistic kind of way (or at least I do), but it is definitely not low profile. Text on the bus? Fugghedabout it!2. Texting: Anyone here born before 1990 may remember this, or may have blocked it out of their mind. T9 texting without prediction? Inconvenient is a mild word for it. Texting is functionally useless for anyone accustomed to the modern era.3. FYI you can't change the wallpaper, if you care.I would not care at all if it got lost, so its a great travel phone for its low cost. Much cheaper than buying an unlocked phone.

I've seen this on other items that Amazon sells.There were previous reviews about BOTH the phone and the manual being in a language thatwas not understandable. Mine came in Spanish. Seller not honest in description of item. See below howto ENGLISH settings.So far, 2 days, I am pleased with the phone. I installed a global SIM from company called""Roam Simple"" and tested texting and making calls FROM USA; it connected to T-Mobile.Works well. I've not used it outside USA yet. Getting connection and call quality will varyin the EU based on country, city, etc. (I have used other phones in the EU.)Call quality / clarity: In US - fine. (my SIM connected to T-mobile in USA.)DUAL SIM ... nice feature ... use one in your country with cheap in country rates. Other SIM use it for yourinternational travel global SIM.Volume fine.

Press center button in UP direction to turn on and off.Phone is great size for traveling.No WEB / internet access with this model. I was not expecting it.Up to 250 contacts.MAKING CALLS and SIM: If you buy a country specific (Argentina) or region (EU) SIM then you may notget service when the phone is in the USA. I bought global SIM for $29. Check with your SIM provider BEFORE buying.NOT ENGLISH: Box was in English, I was hopeful manual would be. It was not - it was in Spanish.I spent about 3 hours looking for a manual. I found full ENGLISH USER GUIDE on the LG Australiaweb site. Search the LG site for A190. The model appears to be the same as the A275 that was soldto Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil) countries.

Gently press down on back cover and gently slide down SLIGHTLY - about an1/8 of an inch. Then from the back, where cover should be extended past end of the phone, lift up the cover.INSTALL BATTERY. If you ever did this on any phone, this should be simple. (NOTE - SIM slots are under the battery.)COVER - back on: DO NOT SLIDE COVER UP. Start with placing cover back on to position whereyou popped it up. THEN slide it up the 1/8 of an inch to lock it in place.CHARGE THE BATTERYThe power input for the cord is under a rubber cover on the LEFT side. It only OPENS on way. BE CAREFUL.Turn phone on its side. With the power cover appearing to your left, gently pry up the rubber cover lifting itat the right edge (the right edge is slightly larger than the left edge of the rubber cover). Lift it about 1/16 ofan inch and then swing it up / out.If you get USA power plug, plug into phone and into USA outlet and charge the battery.CHANGE THE LANGUAGE: My phone's language was set to Portuguese.

Besides that, the charger didn't charge. I had it plugged in for over 10 hours and it didn't charge at all.It was too close to the start of my international trip to return and get another one.

It turned out I was wrong.Pros:1. Long battery life when there is no talk (probably because the screen is always off when the phone is not used)2. Lightweight3. Has a flashlightCons:1. No hardware volume control (and it looks like you can only set the ring volume via the UI)2. The screen and letters on the screen are too small. A twice as big screen could fit in the space unoccupied by the keyboard (or with the same screen size a bigger and more convenient keyboard would fit in)3. Back cover is difficult to open4. Keys are very small5. There is no support for Cyrillic letters. All my old Nokia phones, although they did not allow to type Cyrillic letters, were able to display them. This phone supports only a few latin-based languages and displays squares for Cyrillic letters6. Navigation and control keys are not lit (only number keys are lit). Together with their extremely low profile the phone is very difficult to control in darkness.7. User menu is inconvenient and confusing. Instead navigating the menu I often turn on the flashlight. And instead of turning off the flashlight I often accidentally activate some menu commands.8. Two SIM cards cannot be used simultaneously. You need to activate either one or another.9. FM Radio is bad and noisy. I was able to tune only to 3 stations here in Los Angeles.10. It is impossible to lock the keyboard by pressing a combination of keys. It locks automatically (you can specify the time-out in settings).11. Since the screen turns off automatically after a certain timeout (10, 20, etc. sec.) it is impossible to see time and date and whether there were missed calls.12. It is impossible to change or remove the only wallpaper displaying an ugly flower.Voice quality is average. I can't say it's a pro or con, it's a fact.Overall this is a primitive, inconvenient and basic phone. I would not want to pay more than $10 for it. It cost me $22 (it was $32 on Amazon and I got a $10 discount for applying for Amazon card). Not recommended.",40

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,4,"I like the dual sim feature of the phone. I use a T-Mobile sim card and an international sim card. It is nice to be able to switch between the two sim cards without having to take the sim cards out of the phone - very convenient. The phone is easy to use. The world clock works well when switching between time zones. The only problem I have had is with an SMS message. I wrote a short message and saved to DRAFT. I later recalled it, added to it, and edited the original saved part. When the message was sent, only a very short portion of the message was sent-don't know why. I had previously sent SMS messages and they worked perfectly. Overall, I like the phone and would recommend it.",60

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,4,"Ordered 2 of these to use when we travel in Europe or the Caribbean. The phones came programmed for Spanish but it was easy to figure out how to switch to English. You may also have to look online for an English manual. Phone is small and lightweight but seems solidly made. Not a lot of options but that was fine with me--I don't need to customize, I just want a reliable phone.Just to be able to use them as a backup at home I ordered 2 AirVoice sims at $4.95 each. They arrived in 4 days. Registering the sims online took about a minute, and another minute to buy a basic $10/90-day pay-as-you-go package from Airvoice ($.10 a minute). Slipped in the sim, turned on the phone and it connected immediately with Cingular. Test calls were clear though the outgoing call had a slight noise--may have been the network (I've never used Cingular before).The phone has the typical collection of utilities - SMS messaging, organizer, alarm, stopwatch, calculator, and also a nifty 3-LED flashlight, useful for reading menus in dimly-lit cafes,I deducted one star because the FM radio was virtually useless. It could only pick up one station about 2 miles from me. If that doesn't matter to you, then add the star back.",0

Fortunately, got one sub-menu shows English. Click it and all display turns to English. Now, try to read the manual. Again, it is Spanish. Cannot read it. Search on internet for more for hours, finally, got one English manual. Carefully insert both sim card into the slot, the display only shows one sim card. Don't know its the sim card problem or the phone problem. Decide to switch the two sim cards. To do it, have to take the sim cards out of the slot. It is very difficult to take them out. It requires medical instrument to take them out. If you are somewhere out of home, it is impossible to do it. Even with medical instrument, it is still temper torment to do it. Wrestle for about 20 minutes. Finally, take the sim card out. Switch the sim cards into slot. Turn on the phone, this time, it says both sim card clot is empty. No sim card are recognizable. What's wrong? It is too late to call Amazon to replace another phone. Guess the sim cards should be fine. Guess the problem must be the sim card slot. Cut a thick card board and put it on top both sim card slot and squeeze the battery in to place and put on cover. Turn on the phone again. Now, it can read both sim card. Make call to both sim card phone number, the phone does ring on both call. It seems it is functioning now.It seems that this phone has very bad sim card slot contact.

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,3,"Things I liked: The phone works; I was able to send texts and make calls with an AT&T sim card in it. The sound isn't fantastic but is loud and clear enough. Some features it has are 2 sim card slots, an LED flashlight on the top, an FM radio, and an alarm clock. I like that entering symbols into text messages is easier than on my old samsung phone, which is done here by pressing star then selecting it from a menu. It has a standard micro USB port for charging, which is clearly better than some proprietary connector that you might lose the charger for. Mine came with a replaceable 950 mAh lithium ion battery that seems to hold charge well. It has one external antenna jack under the back cover.Things I didn't like: The phone feels cheap. I hear loose plastic rubbing when I grip it and the keys make a lot of noise. The back tends to fly off when the phone is dropped, which can be a problem since the phone is barely large enough to hold comfortably. I also don't like the small size of the number pad, which could have been bigger if they moved the screen up a bit. The software on the phone is also frustrating, which takes too many steps to select a sim card or turn off sound effects, and lacks some options I thought all phones had. It won't let me change the wallpaper on the home screen from this gaudy purple flower and there wasn't anything about it in the manual. There is no USB filesystem access or SD card slot, so you can only copy your contacts to sim card memory. There is no online support for it in the United States and mine came with a European charger that I needed to find an adapter for. To change a sim card, you need to take out the battery and it asks you to set the date again each time.Overall, this is by no means a great phone but for thirteen dollars plus shipping I think it was worth it.",1

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,4,"My previous non-smart phone had an unfortunate encounter with a pool of water and I needed a cheap replacement. This phone is definitely a downgrade from my last phone, but I'm not at all displeased with it. It makes clear calls and to my surprise the radio function actually works really well.The light on this phone is quite impressive as well (triple LED) but it is not intuitive to turn off if the phone goes into lock mode. This happens if you use the light for more than 10 seconds by default; to turn off the light you have to unlock the phone and then turn off the light. Not too big of a deal.My only other gripe with the phone is due to its small size. The phone is about the size of 2 fingers and such is very uncomfortable to use without a hand. If you try to secure it to your shoulder with your head chances are you will hang up on the person you are talking with.",0

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,5,"I bought this phone to use in UK and France. I purchased a 5 pound sim card, used it for a month in U.K., and also in France (higher roaming rates there, but as I only wanted to make a few calls or text, not worth buying a French sim card too). It's easy to use, no problems with connections and excellent reception - clearer than my U.S phone. No headphone/bluetooth or camera, has very basic tools (calendar, calculator, alarm - plus a flashlight that was actually very useful). For calls to the US, I bought a 5 pound International Calling Card, which gave me enough time to call home every few days on the cell. Received calls are free with most European plans. It was perfect for my needs. If you don't need smartphone capabilities, it's a very simple and economical way to keep in touch with people back home and in Europe.

Not a BIG hassle but it was a bother.Paper came with the phone pointing me to a website for a manual in English.

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,5,I had another brand name phone that was not working properly plus when I travelled I could not always use it to roam. I set about investigating quad band phones. I looked at many but the LG A275 kept cropping up. I read the reviews and it sounded really good. So I went ahead and bought. One for me and one for a friend. After a month or so of using I am really happy especially now when I go to Guyana I can call Trinidad without any problems.I also got an email from the seller enquiring about me and the phone. I thought that was really nice. So I am a really happy customer. Thank you.,
LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,5,I chose this phone because I travel abroad so that I can use it with a foreign sim card and make and receive calls all over the world cheap. It has dual sim and that makes it possible to install 2 sim cards and have 2 different phone numbers in the same phone. This phone is super and money saver for those that travel abroad. The phone is not expensive at all. I love my phone as it comes with super flash light you use when dark and it retains charge for days. That makes it possible for you to talk hours or days without recharging.Simeon Okoli,

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,5,"This is a very basic cell phone that offers the features an international traveler might want: basic cell service on US and international GSM frequencies, dual-SIM capability, rudimentary text support, and it's cheap enough to lose or to give away (which is what we did at the end of our trip). We used the phone in Vietnam with a local Mobiphone SIM, and it worked immediately and flawlessly after installing the local SIM card. I tested it out in the US beforehand. The battery charged quickly and stayed charged for as long as one week in standby mode. Texting was a bit inconvenient, much like cell texting of a decade ago, but it sent and received texts flawlessly. The dual SIM feature works as advertised, although inserting and removing micro-SIM adapters is a little tricky. My phone was apparently from Brazil, and it supported Portuguese, Spanish, and English. It took all of 1 minute to set the phone to the English menus. So it's a great backup or travel phone, and I've bought two more for future trips and as backup for the daily phone. Actually it's so lightweight and unobtrusive that in some ways I prefer it to the smartphone brick in my pocket.",0

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,5,"This is a great little phone. It has two SIM slots so you can choose which account to send/call from. It differentiates between the accounts in your contact list by color and provides you the ability to set a default account but still operate from the other for individual actions if you would like. The one down side is it is not a smart phone so for a guy who is used to the 'swiping' function for texting on my Samsung, using this type of phone for texts is a bit of a drag--but that is not the phone's fault. The battery life is great on this--I only have to charge it about once a week (I am not on it much though--if I was calling or texting more that would probably not hold true). No games or other fun features, but if all you are looking for is a dual account phone, this is a great option--especially for the price. I have used it in Europe and in Africa.

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,5,"I wanted a basic phone for my extra sim card and a foreign sim card from the Philippines that I have on roaming here in the U.S. This works perfectly for my needs. I have two sim cards on it, one from T-mobile and another from a Philippine carrier called Smart. The battery lasts for many days (more than one week) on a single charge if just left on standby. This will be a great travel phone for anyone wanting to travel abroad because it is quadband so it will probably work anywhere in the world, and should be compatible with any GSM sim card. If you want your family to be able to reach you for emergencies while travelling abroad, you could just buy a GSM sim from T-mobile and put it on roaming. You can then buy a local GSM sim in the country where you are travelling and put it on the phone so you have a phone to use for your local communication needs. For a basic phone, it also comes with some cool tools like a calculator, a flashlight (can be turned on with just one press of a button), and an FM radio. It also comes with a calendar and works as an alarm clock.",

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,2,"It's exactly what I was looking for: a small, super-simple phone to use for international travel as well as for an extra local phone for the family. The dual SIM card feature is a nice bonus for foreign travel. I love the fact that it has almost no features... as long as I can throw a SIM card in it and make a call, that's all I want.Problem is, it didn't even work as a basic phone. I could send and receive calls, but it arrived new in the box with a speaker which was completely dead. It would vibrate, but not ring. I couldn't hear anything from the person at the other end, but they could hear me. I downloaded and read the manual, and went through all of the volume settings, but no luck.Since I couldn't actually hear anything, I can't report on sound quality, but from a test call, I was told that my voice came through clearly on the other end as long as I spoke directly into the mouthpiece. But it's a tiny little phone, and if I held it up to my ear, the person on the other end couldn't clearly hear me, and said my voice kept dropping out. Since the mouthpiece only came down to my cheek, I think holding a real conversation might be difficult.No problem getting a cell signal, or sending/receiving calls, using an AT&T SIM card from my home (where we have a strong signal).There's a built-in FM radio, which also didn't work. When I plugged in headphones, I could hear the FM static just fine, but no stations. I don't really care about getting radio from a phone, but when it doesn't pick up any signals near a major city... that's a problem.I really wish this little phone worked, and I still may try again, but I'm not optimistic.",2

This is a great no nonsense phone that was designed with function in mind. You can fit 2 sim cards in this phone that are of regular size. This phone is made of durable plastic that can withstand falls and abuse. The phone is not as responsive as I would like it to be but at this price point and being old technology one really can't complain much and is expected. I currently have this with att and with metro. Two different phone numbers that ring to this same phone. One is my personal number and the other is my business number. The keypad is made of soft plastic and give a reassuring click when pressed. In fact, they keypad is so well designed that I have learned to text with one hand no looking. They menus are easy to read and navigate and the added feature of FM radio is nice. You can't change the wallpaper on this phone. Mine has a wallpaper of a flower but I really don't care much about having custom wallpapers. This phone came in an LG case with a charger and a battery. A good phone for a good price. I would def. buy again and recommend for anyone in the market for a phone as this.",0

This phone takes the larger, older SIM cards. I tried using an adapter into which you insert the nano and micro SIM cards so that they are the same size as the SIM card holder in this phone, but I could never get the cards property inserted after many, many tries and destroyed the adapter and nearly my SIM cards in the process. It's too bad, because this is a small, lightweight phone and is exactly what I wanted, but unfortunately it is $20 down the drain as I will never ever be able to use the phone. So save your money and buy a dual SIM phone that is designed for micro or nano SIM cards.",

If not then get a higher end candybar phone or go for a smartphone.*This phone has great battery life, about 5 days with light usage.*Reception is decent but not the best. I attribute this to the ATT network I used it on. This phone cant use 3G so its stuck on the older and slowly dying GSM network (ATT has better 3G coverage than 2G coverage, check their maps)*This phone does NOT have smart dial! That is about the only downside. I am used to dialing a few numbers or letters of a contacts name and having a list of contacts show up. This is a feature found on even the most basic phones 5 years ago. I don't know why it's not available in this model.*SMS are a pain to type on a 9-key keypad, but that's not the fault of the phone.",

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,4,"When reading about the LG-A275, I noticed two screen variants. One screen has ""1"" and ""2"" with a bit of Spanish on the screen, and the other screen has a purple flower with some English. I picked the vendor who displayed the flower with English. My choice paid off because my LG-A275 was preset to English. The included manual was in French, Portuguese and English. Some random observations as I have used the phone:** The LG-A275 was simple to program, a lot like two Motorolas I had.** The manual says that only 2G SIM cards are supported.** The phone is light and a bit small for my size 7-1/2 hand.** The radio has 10 presets and the autoscan function works very well. Reception was surprisingly good and no SIM card is required for the radio.** There is a headset jack but no bluetooth.** The torch/flashlight function is buried under tools, so you will not be accidentally using it.** The power cord has a European plug and a US adapter. Otherwise, it looks like the adapter for my LG800 phone and has the same specs.** The on/off button does not work in power save mode, and it only works when the screen is unlocked.** If you leave the LG-A275 at the home screen, the device locks itself after 10, 30 or 60 seconds (your choice). It unlocks with a combination of 3 keys -- any key for screen on, left for unlock, and right for Yes. The keys take a bit of pressure, so it should not randomly dial from a pocket.** BEWARE: If you leave the phone in ANY menu mode (radio, contacts, messaging, etc.), the screen goes dark but the phone does not lock!Al in all, it seems like a good option for the car while traveling in Europe.",2

You have to go into the settings and have to manually adjust the volume every time you want a lower/higher volume. The phone is quite small but I was aware of that when I did a little bit of research on the phone. I decided to enroll with simple mobile and the call quality was very clear. If your looking for a basic phone and don't mind not having a volume rocker than this phone is perfect for calls.

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,4,"Surprisingly nice! As others have noted, it's a crapshoot as to what exactly you get in the box. These phones were not intended for sale in the U.S. I got relatively lucky. Mine came with a fairly well-written, although brief, manual, written in French, Portuguese, and English (whew!). However, the included charger was one intended for use in Southern Europe and Africa (two tubes for prongs). Fortunately, I have a set of plug adaptors (they are cheap and available in many stores, including Target) and one of those worked fine to adapt that plug to a U.S. one. Having never before fiddled with SIM cards, I found the instruction book a little unclear (very small photo) on how to insert one. But it turned out to be fairly straightforward after studying the receptacle for a moment. As for the SIM, I went with one from Telestial called Simple Calling Plus. Cost $20, and included $10 worth of airtime, and about the lowest per-minute, no-connection-fee service I could suss out on the internet. They provide excellent instructions with their package and I had no trouble figuring it out. My global phone number is printed on the SIM card holder, and you are invited to obtain another free number for use in the U.S. I did this online in just a couple of minutes, and then tried the phone out in my difficult-reception area. I called it from another phone and bingo! Loud and clear. I think for $23, even with the quirks noted above, this is a great deal on an unlocked quad-band, dual SIM phone. I'm looking forward to trying it out in Great Britain soon. I gave this package only 4 stars due to the ""foreign-plug"" charger.",2
LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,4,"It's not quite as it appears in the photo, identification of sim 1 and sim 2 is not as clear as shown in the example given. Also a few more set up instructions would have been helpful. But after three days I finally cracked it with the help of my global sim provider. When entering a new contact the global sim requires *11* before the number and # at the end of the number (except for texts). That means 2 entries for some contacts. Apparently it's an LG quirk and not a sim issue. Success came on the third day and my immediate tests have proved satisfactory. We live in an area where the signal is very poor and many phones cannot pick up indoors. The LG wins every time with excellent pick up potential. I'm beginning to like it. If you want to switch an existing global sim card to this phone you may have a bit of work to do on your contact numbers,",2
LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,1,Specs listed on line did not specify that not all sim cards were compatible with this phone.

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,5,"Delighted by this phone. Original was purchased for a one time trip out of the country, and on return...we purchased five more. Despite the fact we've always preferred flip phones, and that T mobile is scheduled to terminate their 2G service in 2020.Sensitivity is better than most, speaker is loud, battery life is good, soft keys are consistent, and the codec they used (which I can't identify) actually makes this thing sound like a real phone (despite all those carrier hijinks which typically grant you only 1/6 of a real telephone connection). In short, this is an ""end of 2G system life phone"" - with all those typical 2G bugs removed"". Not bad.Our biggest problem was just trying to locate documentation and facts. Still haven't figured out how to enable the RF connector ""cheat"" because those instructions are in Portugese/Brazilian :) South Americans use these things with a parabolic dish for 50 mile links to substitute for land lines. Might be a good feature to have should you ever get stranded in the Southwest?Some of the more strange comments uncovered? The battery will hold a charge for 6 months when the phone is turned off.

"LG Cam Plus CBG-700 Comfortable shooting grip for LG G5, 100% Original, OEM",LG,49.99,4,"OK, there's some good & bad here. Yes, it does provide a decent grip for the phone, and it's an advantage that you can go from a phone that's asleep directly into camera mode. Downside is that it makes your phone kind of lopsided, and the only protective case for the combination is ~$25 at the time of writing. Ouch: that's almost as much as I spent on the Cam Plus! Which is another point: if you want one of these, you'd better buy it now, as LG has already announced the LG G6 won't support the ""friends"" modules, so this is orphan tech and is going to be vanishing pretty quickly. Get'em while you can!Please note: the Cam Plus has an internal battery that *powers the attachment*, so that helps take the load off the phone when you're shooting lots of pics. However, from my observation, you can't charge the Cam Plus separately: you need to have the phone battery [or a spare, as I did] attached, AND have the Cam Plus module attached to the phone, before you can plug the charger in and get the Cam Plus to light the red LED indicating that it's charging. Even tho' when you plug it into the phone and the phone says ""Battery fully charged"" because you pre-charged the spare, the Cam Plus itself won't work until you charge its internal battery. This may account for some of the complaints of the Cam Plus being DOA, since plugging it into the charger separately doesn't seem to have any effect, and until it has at least *some* charge, the latent charge in the internal battery is insufficient to get it to activate the phone.I haven't really had much chance to fool around with this yet [just got it], but I suspect that I'm going to really like having a camera I can use [not a big fan of the shutter lag and screen-based ""soft"" buttons of most cell cameras I've used to date. Comes from a life-time of using real film cameras I guess.]",3

I have an older cell phone plan that's cheaper than the current plans they offer. The only way they would activated this phone was if I changed to their more expensive plan even though I did not want the data package. This is not a smart phone was my argument as well as being a long time customer. One store manager actually told me customer loyalty means nothing any more. I went to 3 different Verizon stores and spoke with 3 different managers; I called customer service and always the same response: they refused to activate the Chocolate Touch. I researched this product for weeks and read there would be no problem to activate.

The touch screen is sensitive and works well, the slide out qwerty keyboard is awesome. The call quality has always been very good and no dropped calls. I am completely surprised at the number of negative reviews on here and had to comment to offset some. I would buy this phone again, in fact I dropped mine in the dishwater and couldn't bring it back so I am shopping around for one right now. Battery life is also extremely good; only have to charge it every three days or so - I use my phone to text and for calls only. The only problem I have ever had with the phone is that occasionally, when I slide it open, it shuts off and I have to turn it back on. Recent texts are lost for some reason when it shuts off like that, but not all saved texts. My husband got his the same time I did and has never had this problem. I love being able to set my friends and family up as favorites for easy and quick texting. A good solid phone and worth the price.

Of course when I tried to return it, there was no warranty or returns after 30 days. So if you are looking for a throw away phone, then get this one, but I think 7-11 has cheaper ones!!!",0
LG Cosmos Touch VN270 Verizon Cell Phone / Touch Screen / QWERTY Keyboard / No Data Plan,LG,18.43,3,"Honestly it's hard to give any phone a good review when you compare it to an iPhone. But honestly I bought this because it wasn't an iPhone. I needed a phone without a data package and this looked like a good choice (cheap). Truthfully, there didn't seem to be a lot of choices. I do like that the keyboard slides out smooth. I like that it is compact. I really like the price. But the buttons are small, txting is pretty rough. The screen is small, even smaller with all the stuff they pack into it. I also really struggle with the poor interface and the way most other phones function now that the iPhone exists. Either it's a smart phone or it isn't, and when you try to be both the user experience suffers. This is a fine phone for a replacement phone for my twelve year old daughter who broke her other phone and is still under contract. But honestly I would have a real hard time settling for this phone myself.",0

If you are a vocaloid fan, you should really consider getting this phone. I would just like to say this though. I had used Verizon for quite some time but when I got this phone and did some looking into different networks and how they work I realized that Verizon uses very unique technology and after talking to their tech support for quite awhile we concluded that the technology they use is too different from the rest of the world to get this phone functioning on their network. However, I took it to AT&T (as they use a network much more similar to the rest of the world than Verizon) and it worked beautifully. Talk, text and wifi all worked great with just putting in a SIM card. In order to get the over the air internet (3G) working I had to set up an APN on the phone for AT&T's network (you can google the settings real easy).I thought about giving it 4 stars for not working with Verizon, but then realized that I can't take any credit away from this phone for being incompatible with a network that is different from pretty much ever other network in the world. 5 stars from me.",4

Es mi primer Nokia y al principio fue un poco frustrante por que no sabía donde buscar las aplicaciones, yo estaba acostumbrado a los celulares Sony Ericksson y me sentía muy cómodo con ellos pero por las características que presentaba el N97 su gran cantidad de memoria ser de tecnología 3G, los buenos comentarios que había escuchado y por precio decidí comprarlo en lugar de un Sony Ericksson.Como mencioné al principio me frustré pero era mas por desconocimiento que otra cosa por ejemplo le instalé el navegador Opra mini ya que el navegador que el trae no me gustaba pero cuando me conectaba a Internet lo hacía atravez del navegador predeterminado y yo no sabía que tenía que entrar a aplicaciones y de ahí accesar a Opra. Pero poco a poco fui encontrandole las aplicaciones y debo decir que ahora estoy muy contento.Las cosas buenas de este celular:1) Esteticamente es muy lindo, la resolución de la pantalla hace que las imágenes se vean muy nítidas.2)La cámara y el video no tienen nada que envidiarle a un artefacto dedicado es decir a una cámara digital o a una videocamara, las fotos son muy bien logradas y el flash realmente funciona en lugares oscuras se pueden apreciar perfectamente los detalles.3) La conexión a Internet es muy buena, gracias al zoom puedes agrandar o disminuir la imágenes las cuales se aprecian muy bien, logicamente hay páginas que por ser tan grandes no se observaran como en la computadora, pero en realidad la navegación es placentera siempre y cuando no tengas que estar digitando algo.4) Conectarte a las redes sociales o a tu correo electrónico esta a un click de distancia y como dige antes en segundos y puedes leer archivos en formato de word excel o PDF. Es decir si no estas cerca a de una computadora no hay ningún problema te sacará del apuro, aunque repito la experiencia aun no es como con la computadora pero ese es un problema en todos los teléfono inteligentes. Yo reviso mis estados de cuenta, puedo hacer una compra en Amazon pagar recibos entrar al banco hacer transacciones, etc, etc.5) El teléfono es robusto se ve fuerte aunque aun no se ha llevado ningún golpe6) Tiene todas las funciones de los teléfonos convencionales pero a diferencia de otros estas realmente cumplen por ejemplo si tienes una grabadora tu esperas que cuando des click esta realmente grabe y esta lo hace, yo he tenido telefonos que cuando quise usar la grabadora esta simplemente no funcionó. Puedes vivar con ello pero da cólera que una aplicación no funcione como debiera.Pero bueno no todo es perfecto y lo que no me gustó es lo incómodo que resulta a veces el teclado qwerty a veces cuando estoy navegando si por alguna razón tengo que digitar algo puedo desplegar texto en pantalla pero en otras ocasiones esta característica no esta disponible y me obliga a usar el teclado y no se si es la falta de costumbre pero soy mucho mas diestro con las teclas de un teléfono que con este tipo de teclado y me demoro mucho por lo que me resulta engorroso. Pero bueno no se talvez dentro de unos meses ya me halla acostumbrado.Pero por lo demás creo que son mucho mas las satisfacciones imaginense pueden utilizar este teléfono como un GPS yo en la particular no lo uso por que ya tengo un Garmin que es una belleza y al cual ya estoy super acostumbrado pero bueno esta es una aplicación que bien vale la pena utilizar si esta disponible. En sintesís le digo comprelo no se va a arrepentir, a y se me olvidaba la pantalla táctil funciona a las mil maravillas esta era una de mis principales dudas, pero me di cuenta que si funciona y excelentemente bien, el secreto es calibrarla la pantalla a tu gusto, si gustas de apretar mucho el lápiz pues así la calibras a mi me gustan los trazos suaves y así la calibré y apenas dejo caer el lápiz y la función se aplica. Así es que es una buena inversión la única razón por la que no le dí cinco estrellas fue por la razón del teclado por lo demás no hay quejas.",1

First, the reception is much weaker comparing to my old phone (Motorola Ming). Once the reception is lost, it could take a minute or more for you to be able to see some signal bars appeared again. Second, the connection is another issue for this cell phone. It gives a lot of ""connection error"" messages, and I have experienced way more call drops since I changed to this cell phone. Also, the home screen rotates easily from vertical to horizontal, but it doesn't do the same backward. I have to shake the phone with some strength for the home screen rotate back to vertical.

This is a exquisite piece of hardware, the feel of the device is the nicest of any phone I have owned. But the software is really showing its age, even compared to newer, cheaper Nokia phones.Nokia really are asleep at the wheel, the 5530 shows they can do reasonable job of making a touch phone using S60 but they have let their S60 flagship lag far behind other S60 phones that are less than half the price. I gave both the 5800 navigation edition and the 5530 XpressMusic 5 stars based on the great usability and incredible value, but the wonderful N97 hardware is let down by old software.Good:- Wonderful hardware.- Excellent call quality- Very extensive feature set.- Very nice screen in sunlight.- White color looks great.- Nice keyboard (except space bar).- 32GB internal storage.Bad:- Home screen lacks scrolling contacts of 5530.- Inconsistent touch menu (some double, some single tap).- Very small space bar.- Mediocre browser.- Weak FM transmitter (not powerful enough for car use).- Ovi Maps lack search (you need to have google maps installed too).- No in-line spell check.Don't even waste your time comparing this phone to true smartphones like nexusone, droid or iphone 3gs, its just not in that league software wise, only price wise. When you see what google and apple have done so early in the smartphone game, it really is a shame for Nokia. Such great hardware let down by such bad software. And before you say N900, I had one and returned it, maemo shows promise but is far from ready for primetime use and the hardware is a brick.If you have lots of money, already like Nokia S60 phones and have never used an iphone or droid you should love this phone. Everyone else steer clear of it, looks at the 5800 or 5530 if you wanna go Nokia.",1

However, the OS of this phone is old-school looking, and I didn't like that I had to use my nail to select things on the phone. I was use to the iPhone where you use your actual finger. The phone does let you use your fingers, but you end up choosing stuff that is above, below, or next to it. They give you an option to buy a stylus, but why do you HAVE to get a stylus to get better performance from the phone?There were also quite a few buggy problems that I had with the phone, but not serious enough to handicap the phone. This is a nice phone if you don't care about specifics and just need a phone to do basic things on.The camera I didn't feel was as awesome as they keep advertising. The quality was good enough but that's it. Not a huge WOW factor. Video was the same. Then again it is a phone, not a digital camera. I didn't like how I would turn off the flash of the phone and the light still went off when I took the picture (hard to be discreet).Overall, I think the phone was okay, had more cons than pros in my opinion.",0

After the V2.0 Firmware update the phone runs smooth and fast. All the issues i was complaining about when I got it got improved and now it is a perfect phone. The keyboard is good the screen with kinetic scrolling are nice and the homescreen is not only good-looking but also very user-friendly. With 32 GB you can leave your mp3 player at home. It comes with a 3.5mm headphone clinch so you can use your normal headphones.I needed to send it already to repair because i dropped it really hard on the floor. The phone wouldn't switch on anymore and the slider was damaged, too. I send it for repair hoping not to pay anything. I waited a week for a email and actually wanted to call already but then the phone arrived without send me even an email. One week, inclusive shipping! The most impressive part was that they didn't just make it work again, but they also corrected all cosmetic damage. I didn't get a bill or anything. I was really surprised and that is a major + for this phone.I have to take off one point of this phone because of the Ovi Store. Most apps are ''light'' or you have to pay. There are actually very few apps only available. Most of the Ovi stuff are wallpapers and really bad ringtones. They have to really improve that store.My conclusionN97+appstore=the perfect phone.

I will list the pros and the cons I think that the Nokia N97 has....pros*Nice and eye-catching design....Many friends really liked the look of the phone and the sliding keyboard really excited some people*Satisfying web browsing....It has been really nice to look at some much-visited web pages and do some shopping online with the phone, most web sites load quickly and fully*Nice camera*Pretty decent music player....I used this phone with a 16GB card full of music as my primary head-phone music player most of the summer*Large screencons*widgets are a mixed bag...most of them are not really useful and would not connect consistently*""lock key"" on side of the phone has been a real pain....sometimes it would work, then not work, then not unlock, get stuck, etc*the touchscreen is just soooo not smooth and slick. I would often wonder if I had pressed something hard enough or not hard enough.*QWERTY keyboard is not very easy to use. The ""character"" button is right next to the ""space"" button so I was CONSTANTLY calling up a page of characters at the wrong time, which really slows down typing*on screen numeric key-pad is ok for T9 typing but very clumsy.... I am a very heavy texter and this got so frustrating for the amount of backspacing and deleting for most text messages*not pleasing photo gallery....the biggest problem I felt with this was just how unattractive it looks. I once had a Nokia N85 and the way it displayed the photos was very streamlined and neat looking. This device just lays them all out with no styling and also near the end of my using the device it would take so long to load that it got kind of embarrassing if I were trying to show someone a photo*general bulkiness of the device*high price tagand finally I just got tired of it turning off unexpectedly, re-booting itself, not being able to unlock it with the lock key, etc.So, as you can see it really isn't a bad phone. It just fell way short of my expectations for a Nokia ""flagship"" phone and also as a touchscreen device. I ordered the E75 out of sheer frustration and the desire to get away from a touchscreen. I've only had the E75 for a few days but in spite of the smaller screen, I now have a smaller, easily pocketable phone with a VERY VERY VERY nice QWERTY keyboard and a traditional keypad for T9 texting. Very happy with my new phone and kinda glad I don't have to deal with the frustration of all the N97's inconsistencies. Thanks for reading!",2

"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",Sony,269.1,1,"UPDATE: (Changed review from 1-star to 3-stars) After shipping the phone to the Nokia Service Center for repairs (sent on a Friday received back by the following Wednesday), the phone is working fine. There are still a few, small glitchy software issues - but otherwise functioning properly. I am not sure if it was this individual phone or if all N97s have software issues to start. However, now I am afraid to update the phone software, for fear that it will have more problems. One note: it was difficult to get in touch with support and speak to someone ""live."" I sent the phone in on blind trust without speaking to anyone - but all's well that ends well..._____________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have had this phone since July 3, 2009. Since purchase I have had to deal with one issue after another, all related to the software and application interface. The hardware (physical) phone itself was great.Negatives:Too numerous to list all of them here, but essentially the software and applications are not intuitive and have MAJOR issues. I am fairly tech savvy and I cannot even imagine how someone who is less knowledgeable in this area would be able to deal with this phone. Very high maintenance.--It took me, and several tech geek friends, A LOT of time to figure out how to set up 2 email accounts.--The wireless access would not ""remember"" my wireless WEP key and typing that long# in repeatedly is not fun! It started 'saving' it on its own one day. (see reboot story below - now it doesn't save any more)--Facebook app and ""Favorites"" app won't load onto the home screen (just says ""Loading"" but never does). I tried to reinstall the Facebook app, but had to go to a 3rd party site to find it. Nokia's Ovi store no longer has a FB app available. Once an app is gone from your phone - good luck trying to reinstall it. Impossible. If you can even find the app anywhere.--Apps randomly work, then don't work. Very mysterious.Yesterday I had to do a hard reset back to the factory settings (which means I had to back up and then delete all of my data, photos, text messages, music, and loose all of my settings, including difficult-to-set-up email connection settings, etc), to try and get the non-working/disappeared apps to work. There wasn't much else I could do the software was so messed up. It was the last resort to get the phone to function properly. However, resetting it essentially ""killed"" the phone interface entirely. It is so bad that I just sent my phone to Nokia's repair site in Alabama (their ""customer care"" phone and email are essentially non-existant: phone tree loop and a ""generic"" email response is what they consider ""care."") Now, I am waiting to see if/when they fix the phone. Here is how the phone was ""working"" after the hard reset (that was supposed to bring it back to the original factory settings):--The key pad won't function (on screen) so I can't even try another hard reset.--The phone doesn't work (can't access it).--The camera won't function.--Most of the apps are missing. Including facebook and 'favorites'.--Most of the apps that are still on the phone won't function.--The phone shuts off when connected to the computer to update software.--The phone randomly shuts on and off when you try to access an app.--The 'memory full' message keeps appearing when there is nothing on the phone and there are no apps open.Among other issues...My main concerns about having to mail my new, $700 phone to a far away repair place are:(1) now I am stuck with NO PHONE for ""7-10+ days"" and I am trying to run a small business (ironically enough it is for usability testing of products such as this - and boy does Nokia need to test their N97 interface - have they actually read the Nokia Users Discussion board?), and;(2) the ""Repair form"" instructions for returning the phone state that they will ""call me with an estimate of the cost(shouldn't it be free?!)"" or that they will ""return the phone if it is not repairable."" That's just great. Can you tell that I am really annoyed? The phone cost $700!!!Positives:Nice hardware. The keyboard is easy to use and read. I liked the matte feel of the keys. The screen is large and crisp in terms of readbility, and I love the fact that you can use your finger or a stylus (or finger nail - which you can't do on the iPhone) to activate the touch screen. I love the weight and solid feel of the phone. The silver buttons and edging is also a nice touch. The camera, when it worked, took nice photos that rivaled my digital cameras' pics.The white phone is pretty cool looking - too bad it doesn't work!",6
"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone with Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",Sony,269.1,1,"I had a Nokia N95 and I loved it. It was getting a little long in the tooth, so I was looking to replace it. I considered the iPhone but was convinced by someone not to get one but to stick with Nokia. So I purchased this phone. I have never been sorrier about a purchase in my life.The phone not only doesn't hold up next to the iPhone, it doesn't even do everything my old N95 did!No VIOP calls, No Slingbox player, No internet radio, ( all of which the iPhone and the N95 did )all you get is a touchscreen, but no decent software to run on it.I did however try to make the best of it. Until today when it had hung, and I had to power cycle it. Now it is just a lump of useless plastic, as it never came back from the reboot.And Nokia support requires you mail the device in for repairs ( at their discretion ), If I had an iPhone I could walk into any Apple store in the USA and get it serviced.Will I ever by a Nokia product again? Hell no. And please save yourself the aggravation and avoid this phone tool.I wish I had returned it the moment I got it, as now its 14 days too late to return it to Amazon.UPDATE 10/23/2009Well, I got it fixed, and put it up for sale on eBay. Its gone, and I now am the happy owner of the Apple iPhone.Guess what? The iPhone JUST WORKS, no messing about, everything works like a charm. What was I thinkingbuying the N97? Ok. as hardware went the n97 had much going for it. Pretty much everything the iphone had.What was the problem? The OS. The OS on the N97 was junk. Its almost like they weren't trying. If I wanted that experience, I would get a Microsoft phone. Now I see Nokia is suing Apple, maybe because Apple gets what customers want, a phone that is high tech and works.",8

Here are some of the issues I facea) The phone Freezes often requiring the battery to be removed to reset. This for me is a non starter as the widgets and software on the phone should not impede the phones basic functionality but rather enhance it.b) Applications are just not as numerous and ones that exist (Except Bloomberg) are of inferior quality vs similar iPhone/iTouch apps.c) GPS functionality is poor an took a number of software updates to get it to even workd) Phone seems to strangely run out of memory even though a lot is available, it does not seem to be able to load balance memory between partitions.e) Lastly, poor battery life. I cannot squeeze out a full day on while in a 3G networkAll in all it is a poor imitation of the iPhone and if one wants a device that just works and does not have to wait while nokia gets its act together get an iPhone or an Palm Pre.

The N97 was a big disappointment from the very first moment of handling it. The battery cover refused to go on. After thirty minutes of failing and sore fingers, I started reading the manual. For god's sake, I shouldn't need to read the manual to put on a battery cover! The manual was of no help and I began to be violent with it until it was forced on. It has been downhill from there.The N97 is of an exceptional poor design; It looks common from the outside, and is garbage on the inside. Let me review each main function separately:1. Voice: The phone is awkward to hold and speak. The addition of a keyboard really makes it heavy and fat.2. Contacts: This is the WORST aspect of this phone. The phone RANDOMLY chooses when to display an incoming caller Id! All you get is a phone number, and good luck trying to remember which phone number belonged to whom in your contacts. I have had this phone for 5 months now and I still do not know how to fix this major issue. At first, I thought I needed to transfer all the SIM card contacts to the phone's memory contacts, but this did not work.3. Keyboard: The keyboard is not practical. You have to use shift keys for numbers and symbols. A shift key for a period or a colon. A shift key for a smiley face. A terrible Idea.4. Web: The web browser is slower than death, and unresponsive. At one point I almost cracked the screen while surfing from all the frustration. Once you access a web page it is another task to scroll down or sideways.5. GPS: if you are in a pickle or driving and need some quick help finding your way, then don't even consider the N97 as an option. The GPS does not lock onto a signal quickly, it takes the phone a minimum of 15 min to find a signal, and one time it took me 45 min!6. Applications: No good apps. There are applications for facebook, twitter and myspace. However, they are not enjoyable to use. If you have your N97 while among a group of iphone users you will be ashamed to show it off. You look at all those apple users play and laugh about the cool apps they have on their phone, while I am still wondering who is calling me, because this phone can't display the name from the contacts.7. Camera: the photos are OK, not great thought. The flash is a big waste of power, it gives those being pictured a sickly jaundiced look.I urge all who see this to NOT buy this phone, and to tell all their loved ones not to as well. I on the other hand am cursed with this abomination, this travesty of dysform and dysfunction, until I can afford another phone.",3

The phone is larger than the N95 and does indeed have a resistance based touchscreen. The touchscreen was he only thing I felt would make the N95 the best phone ever. However, with the N97 as you chat on the phone your face will activate items on your home screen, particularly an alarm setting.The phone did not come equipped with free symbian software for word, spreadsheets and abobe documents as the N95 did. That you had to pay $20 to download which was disappointing.The internet connection shifting from webpage to webpage is slow to load, even with a 3.5G network, it was very fast(moreso than my computer) on the N95 phone with a 3G network.Many of the features are hard to figure out without a manual and it is annoying to have the memory card inside the same compartment areas as the battery. Everytime you wish to remove the memory card you have to remove the backplate cover of the phone, instead of having a slot on the side of the phone. There are many icons whle connected to the internet and looking at your email that you have no clue what they mean unless you are used to seeing them. Lot of trial and error. Simply the N95 was easier to work with, more compact and lightwieght and came preinstalled with many items of use that I appreciated so the price was worth it.This N97 is too pricey for the lack of preinstalled full useful versions of symbian software.",2

"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Sony,173,1,"Before I write this review, some history. I used this phone for over 1 year, before this I owned a Nokia N95 for 2 years, a nokia 3650 for 4 years and a nokia 2260 before that. Needless to say, I was a big time Nokia fanboy. I was really impressed by Nokia's innovation, sturdiness of their phones and the ease of usability (and sleek designs some might say). That ofcourse changed after N97. I have one sentence that sums up this phone. It does a LOT of things but does not do anything well. I will go over each of its major components and tell why there is a problem: Camera: By far, the best feature of this phone. This is where Nokia did well. Unlike other phone manufacturers, they did not make a phone which also has a camera. They made a phone + camera. The lens is great and the resolution is great. The quality of pictures and all the available options makes it as close to a real camera as possible. However, I compare it to the camera on N95 and I am less than satisfied. The earlier camera was a lot more ergonomically stable and the lens cover was a lot nicer but I'm not going to complain too much about it. Still, the quality of images I get are a little less satisfactory than N95 and it didn't entirely replace my existing camera. I give it an 8/10Phone itself: The phone interface is really weird. Who sets automatic landscape setting on the phone itself? I go and try to answer a phone call and the bloody thing is trying to reset the orientation. So I have to wait before the image comes back on the phone. WTF! And then there is the connectivity. If for some reason I go out of network and then back in, there are chances it wont connect for a while. While my friend (who has the exact same carrier as me) is enjoying a conversation, I'm still waiting for a bloody signal. It is disappointing when the function like calling and receiving calls seamlessly should be the first thing the phone does. I give it 5/10Navigation: A new feature which was installed after I bought the phone. Good except its not very good when working offline. Kinda sucks when you go out of network. But some genius decided that a navigation software does not need a history! What? You mean I have to type the entire address everytime I add it? What if for some reason I accidentally exit? Re-type. What if I go there everyday? Re-type. Weird! And there is no bell or anything like normal navigation systems to warn you to turn now. Silly. 6/10Music player: First is the sync. If you transfer music via the mass memory feature then you wont see the songs in your list but if you sync them via the media sync feature then you will. I dont understand why there can't be one simple way to transfer everything. Why do you have to keep changing the mode? Also, if you push the back button on the song, guess what! It takes you back to the main phone screen! Hey! I only wanted to go back to the album! No sir! You cannot do that at all! Gets REALLY annoying especially if you are listening to music in the car. 5/10Touch and keyboard: The responsiveness of the touch screen is average. The touch keyboard is again a genius design. Why make the touch keyboard just like the old phones when you had to click on one key 4 times to type ""c"". Isn't that the point of the touch keyboard? The thing appears on a screen! Why not have all the letters of the alphabet there? Every other manufacturer does it. Why are you the only idiots who don't? And then you don't even give people the option. Why Why why? 3/10Memory and operating system: Wow! If there is anything that put the final nail on the coffin was this bit of the phone. Lets talk about the memory first. Nokia says the phone has 32GB memory. To be fair, that is true. If you want to transfer your music, pictures etc etc. Yes, it has 32GB of memory. What they however fail to mention is that there is something called a NAND memory. Which is only 64MB! What is this memory you ask? Why, its only the place where the entire operating system and most critical apps sit! Things like maps, push e-mail sit here. There is no way to transfer them to the mass memory as its called by Nokia. I wonder what the designers of this phone were thinking? In this day and age of all these apps that go on to smart phones, 64MB was going to be enough? You run out of memory very quickly and then are left to try and figure out ways to free up memory. It gets old really quickly and starts impacting your phone performance. The operating system is just the worst thing ever dreamt up. It has so many things wrong with it that I don't know where to begin. First off, finding any of the functions it does do is a full time job in itself. On top of that, it flashes a message every time you are out of network. You can't make it go away I have tried. No imagine you are receiving a call. Since my carrier does not have that capability, a message will flash while the call is coming in that data exchange is not possible. I know! Just let me answer the phone. Nope! It will flash that message for however long and then you can take your call. Combine that with the automatic landscape feature, voila! Its almost a second before you are allowed to answer your phone call. You are a bloody phone first! Let me get to my phone call! And the features like weather and e-mail widgets. Shouldn't they connect to the internet and retrieve your e-mails automatically? They do. For the first 30 mins and then stop doing it. If God forbid you get disconnected from network for some reason, the connection aint coming back unless you start it manually. Genius. Oh yeah, and the phone software crashes a LOT! Requiring a restart almost every day. 0/10Ovi store: When I bought this phone, I knew it wasn't an iphone so I wasn't expecting the app store but it should still work right? Here is my experience, I tried downloading an app and paid for it like a responsible consumer but there was an error while downloading. Guess what happened, it couldn't find my app. THere was no way I could go back and re-download it because it wasn't there! I tried contacting the OVI store. There was no phone number listed. So I e-mailed them. It took them a week to get back to me and they weren't able to understand my problem. How hard is it to send me a link to enable me to re-download the app? I am not trying to get it for free. I've already paid for it (my card was charged). Finally I get someone on the phone who tries to blame my network for it and sends me a download link which I have to use in the next 3 hours or it will disappear. I used the same link over my network without any issues. The problem was with OVI store. (Its even a lame name to be honest). There are a bunch of free apps too which are tried. They are all bad. 2/10Other complaints: I have ranted a lot here and I hope people read this and stay away from this phone. Frankly, I am done for life with Nokia products. I read things about their new n900 phone and saw similar issues with it. Here are some more issues I encountered. 1) My charging port broke. Now the only way the phone will charge is if I put it at a certain angle and connect it to my PC. Wouldn't help if I were travelling now would it? I think its past its warranty period so no point contacting anyone. 2) The mini-SD card is just plain hard to use. The card doesn't pop out all the way so you are left trying to pry the card using your finger nails praying it doesn't break anything. All in all, shows how bad the design is. Whatever was good about Nokia was destroyed by this phone. I paid $650 for this phone and I don't think its unreasonable at that price to expect that stuff works. Not only did it not but the things about Nokia like sturdiness, innovation, design etc that I mentioned earlier, are absent. I am thru with Nokia for good and want to warn everyone before buying a Nokia as it seems they don't want to test their products anymore",4

I have till date not seen any software freeze and can work on multiple apps at the same time. I am not a person who is always stuck to the phone for checking emails, face-book but use it while travelling to listen to music, reading pdf or playing games and I can perform more than 2 tasks easily without any issues. The camera is awesome and this was one of the important criteria I went for the N97 instead of the iPhone.Loading music in the cell phone is a cake walk and not to forget the FM that is available. Since I did not have an iPhone, I got used to the resistive touch screens and double clicks for opening the apps even though some of the reviews do mention this as a problem. Keeping the price in mind, Nokia should have included the pdf reader and office for free instead of having it to download from [...] for a fee. All in all the phone comes in with load of features at a price, but I guess if you manage to get an unlocked iPhone, you would probably paying the same price. Lesson learnt..always wait for couple of months for the product to stabilize and then go for the purchase.",1

I was willing the N97 to have a serious gadget, computer and entertainment all in one device. Now i am happy that i made a good decision. The only thing i am facing right now is that there are little apps designed to the 5th edition Symbian OS. I have to recommend the quickoffice great application which gave me the oportunity to transfer my adobe and quickoffice licenses to this edition. The other problem is the battery, i thought nokia was going to fix the duration but it's better to purchase more batteries or i recommend better the new and updated cradle from boxwave. Nokia N97 Desktop Cradle (With Spare Battery Charger) The qwerty keyboard is so great that when you combine the autocomplete option you obtain great productiviy. I'm so happy with the design, but i'm so concerned that the Symbian OS isn't so develop like others, but the multitasking feature is what ended taking my final decision. I chose the black version and now i'm so happy to obtain great features with ovi sync and professional email program of ProfiMail, Try it you're gonna love it!!",2

Sure it has a few glitches and bugs, but have already done two firmware updates and most of these seem to have been ironed out. What piece of technology doesn't have weak points? The only thing that is a little off seems to be the signal strength. I live in a marginal area and it doesn't seem to be as good as previous phones. Call quality is good. In saying that it has improved slightly since the updates. GPS is a little slow acquiring the satellites, but this also is better (not perfect).The one issue everyone seems to worry about is the qwerty keypad. I can assure you that once you get the hang of it, it is simple to use, and it seems that it was designed well. Once you learn the shortcuts it is pretty fast to type on.Battery doesn't last very long - but what do you expect when you are running all the features non-stop and constantly opening it up to play on it - because it is a cool phone.I recommend this phone to anyone.

Now with my new N97 I feel much more comfortable, navigating in the web, working documents, mails, messages. For videos and photos N97 is as good as N95 (very good), except for the len cover in the N97, that eliminates my worries about damages in it. GPS features are identical in both machines, but I perceived better results in my N97 I guess because of the processor speed (loading maps, etc).In terms of storage capacity, 8GB of the N95 was enough for me, but 32GB in the N97 is even better.Finally, I've read some articles related to the dilemma in the market of touch-screen only vs touchscreen+keyboard in smart phones.

I'd rather take a risk on the HTC Touch Pro 2 if you can wait for it on your carrier/afford it unlocked. Or wait longer and see what android phones come out.Rather than bore you with discussion of why I originally chose the n97, lets just get into my experiences:Major Issues:1. It no longer receives text messages except when sending. (This is within a month of buying)2. The exchange email sync locks up regularly and normally has to be manually sync'd when it is working. Also, notes doesn't sync at all for me.3. Even if you install everything to the phones 32GB memory, the phones small internal memory still fills up causing the phone to basically lock up.4. I find myself rebooting the phone regularly to get it to work.5. The web browser becomes unresponsive while loading pages (so if 1 picture on the page isn't loading, you can't browse the rest of the page. I find myself regularly waiting for pages to load rather than reading what is already loaded.) Also, even when loaded pages don't scroll around very well.6. The software availability is much less than I expected. Maybe I'm just bad with google, but it seems like most the programs I want are from the US. And US developers seem to develop in this order: 1. iphone 2. blackberry 3. windows mobile. They just don't develop for s60. For some reason I can never fine the European equivalent of the programs I want. Also, very few programs seem to have been updated from s60v3 to s60v5 so even if someone HAS done the software, it doesn't necessarily work on this phone. That includes most of nokia's own software.7. Battery life is not enough to make it through an entire day if you're using it regularly throughout the day. It'll make it if you leave it in your pocket while you're at work, but if you leave it on your desk, (say because work blocks all the websites you want to visit), you better plan to have it plugged in the whole time.8. The call log stopped recording so I can't see who called me any more.9. I have to leave it on vibrate so it doesn't ring at work yet can rarely actually feel it ring. I don't know if it's not vibrating or just so week I can't tell but I miss 100% of the calls I get when I'm not looking directly at it.10. The phone app does not interact well with any other app so you'll likely screw up a call if you're in an app when you get it. Alternately I regularly have trouble actually hanging up. I don't think the red button on the bezel works the same as the ""end call"" soft button.11. It takes at least 3 clicks to do basically anything whether it's run a program, view a contact or pick who to send a text message to. nothing is well laid out.Minor issues:1. All the configuration options are buried, obscured or unavailable. It's a hunt to try and configure anything.2. The Facebook app requires 2 clicks just to tell it 'yes you can connect to the internet' every time you open it. (This is pretty consistent. Everything wants your personal interaction to tell it how to connect to the internet. This is easy: if available, use wifi, if not use cellular. With AT&T there are another 2 or 3 options I don't even understand.)3. The Facebook app stopped loading pictures.4. It doesn't come with a password keeper and all the options are mediocre on this phone. (There are 3 or 4 options but none I consider acceptable. I could do an entire post on whats wrong with the different password keeper options.)5. Ovi Store doesn't let you re-download programs. It knows you've bought them but it won't let you reload them.6. The podcast program doesn't automatically download your podcasts in the background and it doesn't save your spot in them. (However, I found out if you play the podcasts through the music player it will save your spot as long as you don't play anything else in between.)7. The screen does not redraw well8. The music player is mediocre at best. It seems I have to dig down to the song just to play anything. I'd like to hit 'play' and have some random song play. This is an acceptable player for maybe 2 or 3 years ago. Today people expect a reasonably thought out interface.9. The rss reader is built into the web browser and has to be dug down to. Why can't I just hit an RSS app and have my RSS's, updated, at my fingertips?10. Ok, I know below I throw a bone to the keyboard, but it's quirky. I regularly hit the 'right' key on the d-pad when trying to type which sends my cursor to the front of the text, (where I then type half a sentence before realizing it). Also, I regularly confuse the 3 'alt' keys, (which you'll use regularly). This slows me down and causes me to retype a lot. Also, I'll get an 'alt' key locked in place and type a whole sentence in numbers and symbols.11. Just can't find a reasonable game for it. I just want a simple RPG to keep me busy when I don't have a cellular connection but can't find one that will install.12. The cut and paste are very poorly implemented.That said, it's not a completely terrible phone1. In general, all the hardware is good. They've got a decent platfrom, their just abusing it with terrible software.2. I get a TON of use out of the 32gb of memory. It's just like having a 32GB memory stick with you as long as you've got the cable.3. I like podcasts on my phone. If the software was a bit better it'd be perfect. I let them download in the background and then play them in my car whenever I drive, (and all things considered and morning addition aren't on).4. At least it can kinda sync. It brought over my exchange contacts and calendar. That is pretty nice though I'm not sure it's actually sync'ing changes backwards.5. I like the integration between the GPS, the Nokia 'locations' program, google maps, etc. There's even a program to GPS tag your photos.6. The camera takes great photos and reasonable video. Qik is cool for streaming/sharing video online.7. The keyboard isn't bad inherently. The keys are definitely ok to type on.8. Size and feel of the phone are pretty good. The flip up is great.9. The widgets are nice though I don't use the facebook (I had it up for a bit but I never really cared about anything it was showing me) or the weather (the weather has a solid background which is an ugly contrast to most other widgets that are semi-transparent) widgets.10. It makes a great modem for a laptop, whether as a wifi access point or as a tethered modem. That said, I wish the hardware supported WPA because, being at DEFCON this week, WEP is just asking someone to crack it.Hope this helps others avoid a very expensive mistake. I'll probably try and sell it on ebay and go back to my 8800 while I wait for AT&T to get the HTC Touch Pro 2. I just hope it's not crippled in some way.",4
"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Sony,173,2,"First, let me say that I've been a user of S60 devices for years now. I even had that awful 3650 with its goofball round keypad. Off the top of my head, I've had and used 3650, 6620, 6682, 9500, 9300, E61, E70, E50, E51, E61i, E65, E71, N73, N82, N95 and the ill-fated N97. I even had a 5800XM for half a day, but returned it when I found that the 3G capabilities were hopelessly borked. Fortunately for those users it got fixed, but I never did jump back in on the 5800XM.Back to the N97 though. Crazy version number jumps aside (I read something about 4 being considered an unlucky number in some Asian cultures, so they skipped from S60v3 to v5), I was jazzed about the N97. Under the hood, the Symbian underpinnings that I've grown to know & love over the years, with a slick new touch interface. I even went to the launch party in NYC. That commercial with LL Cool J had me humming ""Mama Said Knock You Out"" so much in my head that I went and bought the song from iTunes.Then I got the phone, retiring my N82. Cue the sad music. First problem - no iSync support. At all. No worries, been there before. I hacked together an N95 plugin back in the day, so how hard should it be? Bzzz.. No go. My method of sync on the device was using Mail for Exchange with Google Sync to sync up contacts & calendar events. It worked mostly, but was a bit of a pain to set it all up. To get the data to the phone, it's My Mac -> Google -> Phone. Of course, that's 2 different 2-way syncs, so there's always potential to have change collisions at the Google part of the equation.Next up - battery life. Wow. It's not iPhone-bad, but it's pretty bad. I will take my hat off to the boys from Espoo on one point here - Micro-usb charging. It's about time, kids. Seriously. Keep that up.The CPU and available memory felt a bit anemic. Not as much CPU as I'd thought would be the case - out of memory was a common message I saw. Definitely slower than I'd have liked, so I must also say the CPU is definitely not up to snuff.The screen. Oh the screen. It's certainly beautiful to look at, no disputing that. I thought the colors were vibrant and looked great. I was concerned that a touchscreen would mean it would be hard to see anything from finger marks, but not so here. My chief problem with the device, which ultimately led me to return it was the screen. The resistive touchscreen employed on the N97 just wasn't sensitive enough. I found myself doing 3 or 4 touches when one should have sufficed.The camera. 5 MP, dual LED flash. It took very nice pics, but why not use a single xenon flash? The flash on the N82 is the best I've ever seen on a phone.I really really tried so hard to like this phone, but between the screen that didn't really seem to work correctly and the < 1 day battery life, I couldn't in good conscience keep it.",8

It's great being able to listen music, check my email, and chat with my wife. I love the camera. This is a major selling point to me because most phones have crappy cameras. The Fm transmitter is also a plus to me. I've used that feature more than I can count. The touch screen is very usable. I wish they would have included a virtual qwerty keyboard. I use the virtual T9 keyboard often and I must say that it is great. The physical keyboard takes alittle getting used to but within days I was typing without much effort.

"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Sony,173,2,"I've got a BlackBerry Bold, as well as an iPhone 3G. I'm not writing this review exclusively for comparing the N97 side-by-side, but given the price of this phone, the bar is set reasonably high. Obviously, nothing's really ""as good as"" a BlackBerry when it comes to e-mail (and you're using a BES), and nothing available right now is ""as good as"" an iPhone when it comes to web browsing or application availability. So for reference, those weren't taken in to consideration.The N97 arrives in a very nice package, with a pre-charged battery and thoughtfully written manual. The included software doesn't run on OS X, so I spent very limited time working with it.Within a couple of minutes of receiving the box, I threw my SIM card in and the phone was happily asking for some settings. What impressed me immediately, is that the N97 seemed to know exactly how to configure itself for data and MMS services. This is the first unbranded phone I've used that didn't need me to enter the settings for my carrier (AT&T).The N97 almost instantly showed a strong 3.5G signal, and started filling the home screen with information. I placed a couple of test calls, and was extremely impressed with the sound quality. Without question, this is one of the best sounding wireless phones I've ever used.And then, the wheels started to come off...First task: sync my work mail, contacts, and calendars via ActiveSync.This started out reasonably easy, until I realized about halfway through the wizard that I had entered a setting incorrectly. Unfortunately, once you have something in the wizard, it's there. There's no ""Back"" button. So, the Mail For Exchange program started complaining immediately.""No problem"" I thought, I'll just change the settings. This turned out to be far more convoluted than it should be. ""Options"" doesn't give you a path to the settings. You have to go to hit the silver button, then go to Applications, then go to the ""MfE"" folder (which is incredibly cryptic, if you don't know what you're looking for) to change the settings.Once I had them changed, the N97 happy started grabbing everything I wanted from my Exchange server. I went back in to Options and saw some well thought out options, like setting ""prime time"" for a constant sync, and a schedule for when you don't need instant access. There were also options for setting Out of Office notifications, and the overall experience was quite good.Second task: set up my personal e-mail account.Having used the wizard already, this was straightforward. The program asked if I wanted to connect to get my mail, and I confirmed that I did. Mail showed up, and all was good. Until I tried to leave the program. That's when I learned that the N97 is apparently incapable of maintaining two mail connections.Annoyed, but willing to accept this limitation, I tried to put the account on my home screen, along with my Exchange account. Apparently, the N97 can't do this, either. You can have one mail box on the screen, regardless of the number of mail accounts you may be using.Third task: connect with my Bluetooth speakerphone.My car has a Bluetooth speakerphone. Since I can remember Bluetooth being a feature on wireless phones, Nokia seems to have dominated this space by including just about every Bluetooth profile under the sun. Pairing the N97 wasn't a problem. After it was set up, I made a couple of calls (which again, had awesome clarity) and thought everything was fine. Until...When I returned to my car later in the day, I noticed that calls weren't being directed to the speakerphone. As it turns out, the N97 won't re-pair with anything on its own. So while I could use the speakerphone with my Bold and iPhone without doing anything at all, the N97 requires you to hit the silver button, then go to Setup, then Connectivity, then Bluetooth, then Paired Devices, then pick the speakerphone, then hit ""pair"" every time.Speaking of which...Fourth Task: answer the stupid phone.I'm not 100% sure this is even possible with the N97. When the phone rings, you have a large bar with an arrow that points to nothing, and is labeled ""Answer"". If you tap it, nothing happens. If you hit the green button, nothing. If you unlock the phone and try either, nothing.Feeling like a complete moron, I had to look it up. It turns out, the bars are sliders, similar to the Unlock slider on an iPhone. Yet, this is really the ONLY thing in the OS that acts like an iPhone.Fifth Task: get Facebook working.This wasn't difficult at all. Enter your name and password, and go. The application looks similar to the BlackBerry version, which I happened to like more than the iPhone version.It does just about everything you'd expect it to, until it crashes. Yes, that's right. Until it crashes. Constantly. Sometimes it does a full ""I'm kicking you back to the home screen"" crash, and other times, you get a red box telling you that your phone needs to be restarted. Sometimes the red box goes away on its own. There's really no rhyme or reason to it.Sixth Task: read my e-mail.Well... on the first try, I had a message that said my phone was out of memory. You see, despite having 32GB of storage for music and movies, the amount of memory your phone can actually use for programs is quite limited. The out of memory message suggested closing other applications, which I did, and which resolved nothing. Rebooting the phone worked.That's when I discovered that the N97 is actually quite awful at rendering mail that isn't plain text.That's also where I started to give up on the N97. In between all of this, I also discovered that:*Your choices for incoming message alerts are either at the same volume as your ringer, or disabled.*Some things need to be double-tapped, others single-tapped, with little indication as to which is which.*The Ovi Store is basically a kludgy mess.*The keyboard will constantly register any key that you so much as brush your finger next to when typing.*There is virtually no connection between what the battery display chooses to tell you, and how much battery life you actually have.*The N97 is basically a hopeless mess of a phone.Admittedly, there are some bright spots:*The back camera takes surprisingly good pictures.*The included weather application is actually pretty cool, since it uses GPS and updates often.*The overall build quality of the phone is quite good.And sure, there are a boatload of hacks and tweaks you can make to the phone to get it to do things closer to what you want. But in my estimation, the amount of research and effort to do so is unreasonable, given this phone's cost.I've also heard that a new software update is imminent (as of this review, the most recent version available for this phone is 12.0.24), so that may solve some problems. But with the N900 not costing substantially more and a release date ""any day now"", the N97 is for Symbian fans only.",8

In the recent past, I have lectured a lot to anyone on how N95 (my previous cell phone) was far better than iPhone. Finally, I've waited anxiously for N97 release since it was announced until I bought my own piece in Amazon, by the opportunity of a friend's trip to USA, because I live in Brazil.The phone handling is quite good, but lacks a lot of functionality and intuitive commands you find in iPhone, but so far so good. It irritated me a lot the constant auto-reset ""obsession"" shown by N97, but I looked to me as an issued to be fixed in next firmware. It was sooo frustrating when I had to configure my e-mail account more than 3 times because it simply disappeared from my phone without any trace...When I was just getting used with all N97 peculiarities and handling, just listening to some music (with no other application running simultaneously), I tapped on the playing song's name and tried to add it to a specific playlist and the phone just froze... and showed the same froze image for over an hour, until I decided to take off the battery and reset it by force, since the hard reset (hitting 3 buttons) wasn't working at all.Well, ever since my phone did not work anymore. Whenever I start it up, it stops and freezes at the white page with Nokia logo. Not even the start-up song is played... In a desperate measure, I left it ""thinking"" alone for over 7 hours, but it didn't revive. Plugging it to a computer and exchanging batteries also did not work.Left it in a Nokia authorized tech support, but they just returned it to me with its death sentence, since it would be necessary to replace the mother board...Now, I'm trying contact with Nokia and Amazon for over 5 days, but still no response from none of them. I think they are going to just turn their backs to me...That's why I am buying tomorrow the new iPhone 3GS 32GB, a more reliable and fancy phone. Why I didn't buy it ealier? Because iPhone did not have video camera and still does not have a true GPS with navigation. Guess what? N95 showed me how it sucks to be trying to reach somewhere and someone calls you... It's annoying. That's why I'll buy also a dedicated GPS, which will certainly work better than N95, N97 and iPhone all together.PLEASE BE SMART AND DON'T BUY N97 AND ANY OTHER NOKIA CELL PHONE.Leandro Armani",9

I wanted a Nokia smartphone so badly that I couldn't wait for the n900. However this will be my last Nokia product. Best said on the forums ""$700 and you too can become a beta tester for Nokia."" I spent a month trying to workaround all the bugs and kinks. The second firmware upgrade did help in that the charger stopped draining the battery and crashes were much more rare. I never got the hang of answering the phone and touching the device without setting off the camera proved imposable. Then the screen broke at day 31. Nokias support has taken a nose dive and told me it would be a month to check it out. However I found a workaround with recalibrating the screen. Sick of the bugs I gave it away to someone who's HTC phone broke. His opinion toned down my hatred of this phone saying it's a great phone for free but paying for the phone makes the quality unacceptable.Pros.-With the warranty GPS upgrade OVI maps 3.0 is fantastic. It stores locally and replaces the need for a Garmin when on buiness trips.- With the warranty lens cover upgrade the camera takes pictures beyond any other phone.- If you delete all the stock apps and reinstall on the 32 gig phone area the multi tasking is flawless beating all other phones hands down.- Once you figure out how to configure the setting the applications are very professional and reliable.- Battery life is vastly superior to other smart phones but not what one has grow accustom to in Nokia.Cons- Quality control has taken a nose dive. It is only beta at best.- Customer support is useless and on the att bad level- Need to sent the phone to Nokia for upgrades.- No t-mobile 3G support- The notifications are too common and awkward ie loud painful beep in your ear telling you the data is not active when dialing on a GSM based network.- Answering is a nightmare. There is a magic combo of lock keys sliding arrows and button presses. I never answer on time.- They throw the camera in your face it is very annoying to always press away from the video call option.- Lots of dead batteries with pictures of you answering the phone and inside of your pocket - There is a wide array of activities that stop the charging process.- poor touch screen response- None standard USB cable-n900 is much better.",2

Phone is very sensitive, turns ons camara and other stuff while opening, closing or just resting in the case, draining the battery and even blocking the screen completely.- Answering a call needs a double action.

I am at firmware 2.0 and it just seems that this firmware just made the phone worse the before. For starts, the phone presents constant lock ups and memory loss requiring hard reset (having to take out the batrery and memory card for the unit to start up). Lock ups are most noticeable when the phone memory (ram) is low, even though no widgets or programs running the phone eats up ram by itself, and you receive a phone call. Right after hanging up the phone locks ups and have to go throught the whole process of reseting the phone. Options for the different screens are hard to acces since have to go through several menues to get to them. The camera lens is very prone to scratches, taking night pictures is basically unusable due to the flash being reflected from the scratches of the lens. Key pad feedback is basically not there, keys have no real sence of travel. The phone is under powered, there is a very noticeable lag between screen selection of a program and actualy opening of the program, screen rotation is slow to the point were you have to shake the phone to make it realise that you wish to go to portrait mode or back to landscape. Overall I personally do not recomend the phone, specially for the price of the unit. There are a lot of other phones that even though, might have less functionality, work a lot better and are less frustrating to use then this unit. Support from Nokia is lacking, not very helpfull when you finally are able to contact them.Overall a very disapointing experience, leaves you feeling as if your were ripped of for paying a premium price for a substandard so called phone.",8

The software was very unstable and if you haven't used the Symbian Interface before, it is not as intuitive as other smart phones. I'm not exagerrating when I say the phone for whatever reason froze up while being used at least 3 times an hour. I would have to remove the battery and put it back in to get the phone working again and this was the ultimate deal breaker. The fact that I couldn't browse the internet or perform basic functions on such an expensive smartphone convinced me to return the phone the very same day.

Saw all the pros and against in many sites and based my decision upon them since I didn't know anybody who had it. I was willing to spend some money so I tried to choose carefully. My main driven was the physical qwerty keypad, updated technologies and the large screen. The N97 fulfilled them (except for the size of the letters in the keypad where Nokia did it again - TOO SMALL for people above the 40!). It's nicely built, very powerful and rich in specifications so I guess it covers almost every possible need with its 3G, GPS, bluetooth, WiFi, qwerty keyboard, touchscreen, SD slot, excellent camera, etc but I am afraid I (or it) was not prepared to deal with too many technologies put together. The system is not fast enough to manage them all and probably because of my anxiety it had actually frozen and had to be restarted twice in one week using it. I also fail to recognize the logic behind the menu tree, probably my fault as well.I still have a lot to learn and explore, since, as I said, it's a very resourceful machine. So, while I do not intend to give up, I am a bit disappointed with the so waited phone but, having experienced the only competitor for most of my needs, the Iphone, and being unable to deal with its touchscreen keypad, bottom line, it is still the best choice for me so far.",0

I know both work as I've tried both, however I can't remember them of hand, google can help. the back doesn't seem well made to me, but it's held on rather well so maybe it's a little stronger than it appears. there is one app, accuweather that comes on the phone, I've had issues with this app from the start, it rarely works, recomendations on fixes or a better app is welcome. often times the phone will have issues connecting to the net, for no reason whatsoever the web browser will keep giving connection errors, most people have recomended powering the phone on and off to get it to reconnect. I found a quicker way that usually works. exit your browser and go to home screen, hold the end call button till it asks if you want to end data connections, answer yes, relaunch browser. works nearly everytime but sometimes you still have to resort to restarting the phone.overall my thoughts on the device are it's worth the money. most of the problems it has are fixed with the current firmware update, there are still a few lingering problems I hope the 2.0 update coming out will fix. but for someone who wants a decent media phone with lots of space, it's definately worth the money.",0

"Nokia N97 Unlocked Phone, Touchscreen, 3G, 5 MP Camera, A-GPS, 32 GB, MicroSD Slot, and Integrated Ovi Applications--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Sony,173,3,"I absolutely hate touch screens, yet I bought this phone.Why?This is a question for Nokia: if other people hate touch screens like I do--and they do--why do you think they'd buy the N97 with its inferior resistive touch screen over the iPhone's superior capacitive screen?Here's the reason: FULL QWERTY KEYBOARD.So when you make a phone with a ""full qwerty keyboard,"" and then you omit a dedicated row of numbers, it's not really a full qwerty keyboard now, is it? I come from a long line of QWERTY Nokia phones such as the 6820/6822, E70 and the Nokia E90 before this. The E90 has a full keyboard, complete with ctrl key so you can do seemingly simple things like copy (ctrl+c) and paste (ctrl+v). With my Nokia E90, typing was a breeze. You could even skip between words in sentences while typing text messages by holding ctrl and pressing left or right like you can in Windows (or even highlighting those words by pressing ""shift"").So imagine my disappointment when it took me a full minute of hunting through menus to forward a contact's phone number to someone via text message. Short of looking up the number, writing it down on a piece of paper, then typing it back, there's no other way to do this. What was a simple task on E90 and E70 (simply click options on the contact and it takes you to a sub-menu where you can copy the phone number into your clipboard), is an unwieldy chore on the N97. Here's how to copy a phone number to your clipboard: Contacts->Click on the contact->Options->Edit->Click on the phone number->Options->Editing Options->Copy->Start->Drag your finger across the number->Click Done. Absurd! And Lord knows how to paste it once you have it on your clipboard (you can only paste in apps that support the ""Editing Options"" submenu, so forget about pasting information in forms and menus on the phone for a quick lookup). I've scoured the Internet and there's simply no way to do this.Nokia has literally reduced functionality on this phone.Also, I can't stress enough how annoying it is to have to shift to type numbers, and to have to shift to type a comma. Are you kidding me? Commas are (or should be) the most used punctuation, up there with the period. Nokia's choice to make you shift to get a comma is dumbfounding.About the apps:-----------------Browser: the browser is frustratingly stupid. In older Nokia phones, you could simply type shortcuts while browsing 1 = enter URL, 2 = search, 3 = reload, 5 = switch between windows, etc. They removed this functionality from the browser. Why?! It's so annoying I could punch a vase. Why did you remove functionality that you had before, Nokia? Why? Nice one.-Facebook widget is okay; mostly sizzle, little steak. The presentation is nice, and it updates pertinent information, but you can only scroll through 20 or so entries in the live feed. There's no way to go trawling through a day or two of updates like you can by simply pointing your browser to the mobile version of Facebook.-Amazon app: throw it away. It's little more than a mobile front page that literally takes you to browsing on Amazon's mobile site.-AP News: does what it's supposed to. Video quality was good, news is what you'd expect from AP. Fairly functional app.-Guitar Rock Tour (like Guitar Hero): boring and unresponsive on the touch screen.. you have to tap too hard to register a click, so it slows the gameplay down and is exhausting to play.-AccuWeather: fairly accurate weather forecasts, though typing ""weather [zip]"" in Google seems to give more accurate results (AccuWeather seems to return results for the city you're in, but in a large coastal city like Los Angeles for example, a few miles can make a big difference).Usability:-----------There's a volume control button on the side that pivots up or down, and it only seems to work on calls. Since the buttons are there anyway, why not put them to use by allowing users to scroll up or down through menu items or web pages? Dragging around on the touch screen is frustratingly inaccurate and a chore.-There's a nice lock button on the side of the phone that seems fairly responsive (you can lock/unlock with a flick of your thumb). It did occasionally leave the screen black when I unlocked. I've updated to the latest firmware and haven't noticed the issue since, but it's disconcerting when it happens.-Exiting applications is TORTURE. In other Nokia phones, it's fairly easy to exit (just click the menu item, press up and it takes you to the bottom of the menu to exit). Or simply press the red ""hang up"" button and it will exit most apps. Not here. Pressing the red button does nothing (it only takes you to the home page). So before you know it, you have 20 different apps running in the background, all hogging up memory.-When you enter a sub-menu like the one for choosing symbols by pressing the ""Sym"" button on the keyboard, it's impossible to exit this menu. You have to choose a symbol, even if it's one you don't want, and then erase the symbol you chose. This underscores how poorly thought out the usability is.-Typing while in touch screen mode requires you to use a 10-key pad like on a traditional cell phone, and doesn't allow you to type using a full on-screen keyboard. This is so incredibly stupid that I almost vomited.Anyway, the phone has some pluses, such as the 5 MP camera, good 3G support, good storage, fairly quick, etc, but I won't go into the positives because there are a lot of other reviews on here that do. I've found that the negative reviews are always the most helpful on Amazon, even when an item has thousands of reviews (the negatives always point out stuff that I would also find annoying), so I hope that's also the case with this review.As I write this, I look at my pretty new N97 sitting next to my clunky old E90. The E90 is a beast of a phone, and yet, it did what it was supposed to do, and didn't make you jump through hoops to do it. I'll probably go back to the E90 and its dated apps, even if I have to use the terrible EDGE network for Internet. What I lose in transfer speed will be made up for in typing speed.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 11/30/2009I've now used this device for a few months, and have a few more insights and grievances:1. There is very little thought put into the alarm clock function. This is something basic I use all the time--instead of a real alarm clock in fact, so it's important for it to work well. When you set an alarm, the default setting is to create a permanent alarm that would repeat in 24 hours. Most people use alarms for quick reminders, such as when you park at a meter, or to take something out of the oven. So it's super annoying to have to go through and click ""do not repeat"" through a sub menu 5 times per day. Here's what really annoys me: even Nokia doesn't believe it should repeat 24-hours by default, because when you set an alarm for an event in your calendar, the default is to NOT repeat. Why the inconsistency Nokia?2. The slider button to unlock the phone is STILL GARBAGE. I thought it was a good idea, but it works correctly only 2/3rds of the time, even after numerous firmware updates (I always keep up to date). The slider leaves the screen lit every now and then, even when the phone is locked. Sometimes it does nothing (it vibrates but screen stays dark). Sometimes it's laggy so when you unlock it, it does nothing, then you do it again and it quickly unlocks and locks. Stupid. Get it together, Nokia.3. When you're on a phone call and you have to access any applications (such as your contact list to give someone a number), it's hard to get back to your dialer quickly (so you can switch to loudspeaker or switch calls). You have to hold down the button in the lower corner for 2 seconds, then flip through your open applications to your dialer. Stupid. Why does everything take so long to do on this phone?4. Speaking of, the entire phone is TOO SLOW. Basic functions like flipping from portrait to landscape, or pulling up your contact list, or going from locked to unlocked when you answer a phone call are almost always laggy (even with no running applications).5. Browser still has no keyboard shortcuts.6. Copy function is slightly improved (you can drag your finger across text in a text message and a ""Copy"" button will come up), but pasting is still IMPOSSIBLE unless the application specifically allows you to paste. So if you get a text message with an address in it, and you copy the text message into your clipboard buffer, you can't paste it into another application like say, Google Maps. You know, THE ENTIRE POINT OF COPYING AND PASTING ADDRESSES. UGH.7. The proximity detector doesn't work half the time. I'm so tired of the phone going to mute or to some random application because it was held up to my head while the phone's screen was active, so it thinks I'm pressing buttons with my face. Stupid.8. I hate this phone. The only reason I'm still using it is because of a few opensource apps that only exist on it, and it supports the US 3.5G networks, which the old E90 doesn't.I miss my E90.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 9/8/2010I absolutely hate this phone. I hate it.I've upgraded the firmware 3-4 times, I lost count. Nothing seems to help. The device lock still doesn't work. Sometimes it locks the screen (if you wait 3 seconds after a call), and sometimes if you don't wait long enough after exiting an app, it locks half the screen (most of it is dark but parts of the UI are still lit). Sometimes it doesn't do anything.I'm rebooting this phone 3-4 times per week due to lock ups. I tried to update Ovi Maps, but it still tries to download to the C: drive despite setting my download drive to E:, and it runs out of disk space. There's nothing more I can remove or delete on C: to run this update. I'm so tired of Nokia. I'm not the only one... the people who used to run Symbian Guru shut down the site recently. This is a big deal. There are no bigger advocates of your product than loyalists who run sites like Symbian Guru. To quote them:""To Nokia, you guys are losing. Hard. Wake the hell up. Doing the same thing repeatedly while expecting different results is the definition of insanity. I've been a huge Nokia fan since my 2nd cellphone, and I just can't do it any longer. You guys aren't competing like you once were, and everyone but you seems to see that. You used to build the world's best smartphones, the world's best cameras, the world's best GPS units - you've lost pretty much all of that, and with nothing to show for it. You unveiled your Ovi vision over 2 years ago - I was there. Today, it's still a complete mess. I have to log in every single time I visit the site - regardless of how many times I check the `remember me' box. I spent 6 months (and about 3 hours at Nokia World 2009) trying to find someone to help me with Ovi Contacts on the web - no one knew who to point me to. You spent millions of dollars purchasing your Ovi pieces - Ovi Files, Ovi Share, and a host of other little companies - are you proud of what you `built' with them? Most of your own employees (that I've talked to) don't even use them, so why should I?""I hate almost everything about this phone. If it didn't support the faster 3G network (faster than other Nokia phones), and migration wasn't such a chore, I'd have ditched it long ago. Alas, there are no great Qwerty phones with all the features I'm looking for, except maybe the new Droid phones coming out. I think that's what I'm going to move on to. Nokia's inability to satisfy their core user base with high quality, high up-time units has lost me as a customer. Nothing short of a full refund and an apology would get me back to Nokia's arms again.",11

Solidly made, QWERTY keyboard makes texting quick, easy, and accurate, but there is also the touch screen. The maps feature can work by satellite GPS alone - so if you are really in the boonies -- and I get into those areas -- you can still get a fix on your location, even though you are not near a cell tower. I combined it with a ATT prepaid plan, so I get plenty of voice minutes, unlimited texts, and adequate data for $30 per month. Yes, $30. This is the frugal person's dream. And, it works with maps (for free) in over 70 countries. All for $200.

Yes, the phone is big and heavy, but it is also nearly bullet-proof, and the keyboard is fine. Really it could replace any netbook/tablet for the uses they have been built for.Now, the bad. I went around and around, finally rating the phone for a 2. It's because of the way Symbian runs, and the small working memory (the only hardware shortcoming). This phone could easily be a 4 star or better except I am so tired of working around the ""memory full"" error, and the lack of apps. And apparently that is because even for my unlocked phone, Nokia has it wrapped up so tight that about half of the apps I want to install need hacks to get it done.

The N97 was a big disappointment from the very first moment of handling it. The battery cover refused to go on. After thirty minutes of failing and sore fingers, I started reading the manual. For god's sake, I shouldn't need to read the manual to put on a battery cover! The manual was of no help and I began to be violent with it until it was forced on. It has been downhill from there.The N97 is of an exceptional poor design; It looks common from the outside, and is garbage on the inside. Let me review each main function separately:1. Voice: The phone is awkward to hold and speak. The addition of a keyboard really makes it heavy and fat.2. Contacts: This is the WORST aspect of this phone. The phone RANDOMLY chooses when to display an incoming caller Id! All you get is a phone number, and good luck trying to remember which phone number belonged to whom in your contacts. I have had this phone for 5 months now and I still do not know how to fix this major issue. At first, I thought I needed to transfer all the SIM card contacts to the phone's memory contacts, but this did not work.3. Keyboard: The keyboard is not practical. You have to use shift keys for numbers and symbols. A shift key for a period or a colon. A shift key for a smiley face. A terrible Idea.4. Web: The web browser is slower than death, and unresponsive. At one point I almost cracked the screen while surfing from all the frustration. Once you access a web page it is another task to scroll down or sideways.5. GPS: if you are in a pickle or driving and need some quick help finding your way, then don't even consider the N97 as an option. The GPS does not lock onto a signal quickly, it takes the phone a minimum of 15 min to find a signal, and one time it took me 45 min!6. Applications: No good apps. There are applications for facebook, twitter and myspace. However, they are not enjoyable to use. If you have your N97 while among a group of iphone users you will be ashamed to show it off. You look at all those apple users play and laugh about the cool apps they have on their phone, while I am still wondering who is calling me, because this phone can't display the name from the contacts.7. Camera: the photos are OK, not great thought. The flash is a big waste of power, it gives those being pictured a sickly jaundiced look.I urge all who see this to NOT buy this phone, and to tell all their loved ones not to as well. I on the other hand am cursed with this abomination, this travesty of dysform and dysfunction, until I can afford another phone.",3

Really frustrating phone.Complaints:-- Processor is not good enough to handle phone's own applications -- phone freezes all the time...-- ... In order to reboot it you need to pull out the battery...-- ... And than wait for a long time for it to load...-- ... Which doesn't happen all the time so every now and then you have to remove the battery and restart it again-- Its happening now AFTER I upgraded software, before it was an even bigger nightmare-- Applications are scarce and of much lower quality than iphone apps-- constant ""not enough memory"" error messages. Come on -- the phone has a ton of memory -- its just that N97 OS doesn;t know how to use it. My overall experience is like i'm running windows95 on this phone...Bottom line --> if that was a car and Nokia was a responsible company they would have recalled the phone.

The phone is larger than the N95 and does indeed have a resistance based touchscreen. The touchscreen was he only thing I felt would make the N95 the best phone ever. However, with the N97 as you chat on the phone your face will activate items on your home screen, particularly an alarm setting.The phone did not come equipped with free symbian software for word, spreadsheets and abobe documents as the N95 did. That you had to pay $20 to download which was disappointing.The internet connection shifting from webpage to webpage is slow to load, even with a 3.5G network, it was very fast(moreso than my computer) on the N95 phone with a 3G network.Many of the features are hard to figure out without a manual and it is annoying to have the memory card inside the same compartment areas as the battery. Everytime you wish to remove the memory card you have to remove the backplate cover of the phone, instead of having a slot on the side of the phone. There are many icons whle connected to the internet and looking at your email that you have no clue what they mean unless you are used to seeing them. Lot of trial and error. Simply the N95 was easier to work with, more compact and lightwieght and came preinstalled with many items of use that I appreciated so the price was worth it.This N97 is too pricey for the lack of preinstalled full useful versions of symbian software.",2

Sony Ericsson TM506 Unlocked QUAD-Band 3G GSM Cell Phone,Sony,269.1,3,"This is an addendum to my seller's feedback. Though poorly packaged, the item is new [I think...], except for the battery and a tiny piece of rubber that's supposed to be covering a screw for vanity reason. The battery was in the box with the rest of the stuff unprotected/unwrapped with minor stains/dents. The original packaging from sony ericsson is very generic. There is no model number/serial with photos on box as you would expect if purchased from a sony store. The owner's manual is a generic one, not printed for any particular models. Inside, the phone/accessories [ie; battery, charger, lid] were tossed together like a salad, nothing was securely in their proper slot. I am not sure if that's how it came in from the manufacturer [sony ericsson] to the wholesaler, but this purchase could easily be mistaken for being used or refurbished. Fact, I check my purchase details several times upon receiving the package just to make sure I purchased a 'NEW' item vs used or refurbished. Nothing personal, but I'd think twice about this company before purchasing from them again. As for now, I am content with the item 'cause it works. Im keeping my fingers crossed hoping that it will hold up like a sony ericsson and not breakdown on me because it was mishandled by a third party, or it was used/refurbished and listed as new. For what it's worth, thank you UnlockedCellPhoneKings. You have made quite an impression on me.",4

"Sony Ericsson Unlocked Vivaz U5 U5i (Blue) Unlocked, International Version with No Warranty",Sony,136.5,4,"I'm still learning and bonding with my phone since acquiring it in April. This is my first smart phone, but it's a great transition from old school to the new models. I happened upon this phone after months of researching affordable phones and features, I was ready to give up and settle for something less. And then I saw this blue Sony Ericsson Vivaz U5. I was drawn to the 3G phone with the 8 mp camera and recording features that are easy to operate. However, I'm disappointed in my night and long-distance photo quality. It takes great action shots of kids on trampolines! I love the 3 options for texting, plus the slimness, lightness, and is easy to hold. The screen size is just right, and the scrolling is easy. As for battery, I only recharge a couple times a week--depending on camera use. It recharges pretty quick within an hour or two. One annoyance is whenever the phone is not used for a couple of minutes, it reverts to locked mode, (kind of kid-proofed), but all I have to do is press the green ""on"" button once and hit the ""Unlock"" and I can place calls. I still haven't figured out how to transfer my pictures from the phone to my computer or on-line, even using the USB cord attached to the charger cord that came with the phone. The phone was set up for AT&T which means it was new, but still locked. Issue was resolved after a week's worth of e-mails. Although it has lots of apps, I don't use the Internet with it because I currently use Net10 prepaid service that requires the $50 card, but doesn't include data. I'm very happy with it,",0

This phone really fits all of that. I wanted it small enough so I could put it in my pocket when going for a run...again, it works. There are many disappointments for me though. #1 There is a space on the top of the phone where you put in the SD card...it already is worn out and pops up at anytime. This makes your podcast or music stop, once you clamp the top back on, it restarts whatever you were playing. #2 Texting. I'm not a huge texter, but this phone isn't the easiest. I had a Samsung rugby that seemed way easier. also...I've already had multiple times when my texts don't even get to the person I'm trying to contact. #3 The charge cord must go in the same place as the headphones.....so no charging your phone while using your headphones. #4 The headphones jack isn't the standard. You have to buy an adaptor which for me isn't ideal. It's almost a complete deal breaker. #5 While driving, I like to use the speaker phone, this is difficult because it is muffled.

Sony Ericsson W580i Unlocked Quadband Phone (Black),Sony,269.1,4,"The phone is a great size. They matte black and orange is attractive. The slide works. The center button/circle takes a little more force than I'd like to push down, you have to really press on it. The screen is bright and the voice quality great. The music for the walkman part is great as well. I like the exercise tracking things that are included. Over all a nice phone. Cons: The screen really needs extra protection, I could see how it might break without something covering it over time; the battery. This phone drains almost half way down in one day of NON talk time. Seriously. If you make what seems like a few fairly short calls, by the end of the day the battery is about 3/4 gone. I can't imagine getting into an emergency situation where I'd need to talk for a long time, or be away from a power source as I'd be totally out of luck. As you can't turn the screen down to less than 50% brightness (plenty bright) and there are extra lights that you can't turn off, I can't even imagine having bluetooth or the internet turned on continuously as you'd end up with a dead phone probably 1/2 way through the day.

I can move my SIM and use it for biking, skiing, etc. My wife also enjoys the walkman phones as well. I really wanted to upgrade here to the W995a for Christmas. We had one but over use and wear and tear it needs to be replaced. I really want to get a W995a and was excited to see it here on Amazon. I see that this same seller orderinstantcom has both listing right now on Amazon. They show 2 separate listing, W995A and W995. I have attempted to order from them twice, to order the W995a. And they seem to have a good price and are prompt , ship right away , and the product shows up right away. Unfortunately they have shipped me TWO W995 international version twice in a row.

I did get prompt RMA service and FedEx the phone right back to them and am awaiting the credit back now. The 2nd order arrived today and was still wrong , so i am awaiting a 2nd RMA to get that one sent back. I am hoping to contact them directly and get a response because i really want to get the right product and am willing to try again and order the W995a if i can get the ""A"" Version.The plain W995 ( no a ) is still a great phone and will work on the GSM bands in the U.S. and overseas but will be slower on data and not support 3G in the U.S. the bands and electronics (internally to the phone) are different between the W995 and W995a and there is no Flash or Upgrade or Crack or anything you can do to make the non A version become the A version.Connectivity Data i got from Sony.Wireless Radio GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz UMTS 850/1800/1900 MHzCompatible Carrier & Service AT&T, AT&T 3G, T-Mobile, Rogers, Fido3G 3G / UMTSWi-Fi Support IEEE802.11b/gData transfer GPRS, EDGE, HSDPA, WiFi",0

Lotsa pre-loaded and downloadable free games from Sony are nice! Conversation-style texts are a nice new feature. Battery life is awesome; usually 3-4 days between charges. Best new feature?

"Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",Sony,269.1,2,"I have been a Sony Ericsson cell phones fan since 2004. Last year (December 2009) after much thought I decided to buy this model being this the top of the line of the ""old school"" SE phones and by ""old school"" I am talking about the W,K,C and such series and not the newest models like the AINO or SATIO. Anyway I ended up giving this phone to my sister and I bought instead a iPhone 3GS much to my dismay. Why? Because the [...] application in the W995a just can't compare to the iPhone application. Even tough the W995a screen is way smaller than the iPhone one the video resolution is terrible, really terrible and almost unsee-able. When I made a comparison with the youtube iPhone application the difference was abysmal. The other big problem is with the camera. I mean, this is a phone not a professional camera but come on, it says 8.1 mega and the photos are worse than your regular 2 mega camera. Even the iPhone with just 3.2 mega takes better pictures. I think is the lens quality (very bad) that makes the W995a such a lousy ""camera phone"". Don't get me wrong: this is Sony Ericsson at it's best and as always the conversation audio quality is great, reception is great but when you come to other features like web browsing and reading emails this phone really fails in comparison with any smartphone, from HCT to Nokia to Apple. Even tough the screen is bigger than other phones the text is also big so you don't really use the bigger screen and the small font is unreadable. In conclusion: This is one of the best phones available but as that is VERY EXPENSIVE because in other features like web browsing, reading emails (it can't read any office or pdf attachment) and almost other applications it fails in comparison with other phones, specially with a iPhone. It really is a shame because this is the end of a love relationship with Sony Ericsson I have had since 2004 and I never thought I was going to get a iPhone but this phone didn't meet my expectations at all. As the title says, the phone really disappointed me. One last issue: the keypad is awfully small and very very hard to use. Other SE phones down on the range offers better keypads. The walkman function of the W995a is great I have to say and the 8g memory stick is great. I know this review seems like a contradiction but it is because its hard to say only bad thing about a phone made by a brand you have been in love with for so many years.",1
"Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",Sony,269.1,4,"Not a smartphone, yet pretty smartAfter my Nokia E51 came to an end, I started looking for a replacement that would best suite my needs. Taught by previous experiences, my aim was a larger screen unlocked phone equipped with GPS device, intuitive user interface, decent sync, email and tethering capabilities, W-LAN and a modern media player.After days of research, my choice came down to two models: Nokia N86 and Sony Ericsson W995a. Both feature excellent characteristics, and seem to perfectly meet my needs. At the end, the design weighted in favor of the SE.The phone comes in three flavors: Red, Progressive Black and Brushed Metal. I bought mine from Amazon, and they only had the Progressive Black Model. Note that my model's name is W995a, which means that it supports frequencies across Americas, but rest reassured, it works in Europe and Asia as well on all networks, GSM and 3G.When you take it out of the box, it smells good, feels new and geeky :) Once you get to play with it, it feels solid in hand, and the sliding mechanism is excellent. The phone comes with an USB cable, wall charger, headphones, battery, printed and electronic documentation, and a generous 8GB memory card. Note that some operators in certain countries give you a set of plug-in stereo speakers, but those don't come standard.It's a slide form factor quad-band phone with 2.6"" display, 8.1 MP camera, kickstand, secondary video call camera, Sony Walkman with dedicated buttons, 3.5mm audio jack (thank you, Sony Ericsson, it was about the time) W-LAN, and loads of other features.At first, I found its buttons rather uncomfortable, for they are fairly flat and wide, and you need to operate them with you fingernails. The upper command buttons feel odd too, especially answer and hangup ones, for they are located at the very edge of the device. But it did not take me long to accommodate.The display is fairly large, showing crisp and clear images, and allowing various sizes of text to be displayed correctly. Its resolution of 320x240 pixels isn't exactly the top of the class, neither is the color range of mere 256k. However, I ran a test with a .jpg image taken with my Nikon camera on Sony Ericsson W995 and Nokia E51, featuring 16M colors. Surprisingly enough, comparing side-by-side the two models, the W995 display proved to have more vibrant colors, and the overall impression of the image was by far better Nokia's one.The phone comes with its own default animated and beautiful theme that goes great with its design. If you prefer the classic Sony Ericsson looks, you can switch back at any time, though the selection of themes that comes pre-installed is poor.Experience of browsing through menus, writing messages and making calls is ok, even though the interface sometimes lacks responsiveness due to animated themes and quantity of contents.Furthermore, W995 comes with tons of apps and features you easily get used to and never want to leave behind. For example, pedometer, accelerometer, shake control, location service, and many great solutions that exploit this hardware make this device a very versatile must-have multi purpose pocket device you always want to carry around. Less known goodies of this products are the camera flash that can be used either as torch or as SOS signaling device, and the USB battery charging capability. The last one is particularly useful when you say tether it with a computer to go online. This normally drains your battery very quickly, but in the case of W-series, your battery is being recharged instead of consumed. And when you press the +/- volume button in standby mode, it displays a clock with some basic information across the entire screen. Additionally, the phone comes filled with cool games that are great for killing time on airports :) and a coupon for a free download of 100 Sony production songs.What I particularly liked about this phone is the ease of tethering with any major OS platforms out there. I've tested it on a Mac (Snow Leopard 10.6) and Windows XP Professional, and it worked like a charm. With W995, using your phone as a GSM or 3G modem is no longer a nightmare. The functionality is built right in, and when you connect it to any computer via an USB cable, you get prompted to choose amongst the fallowing: use your phone as modem, mass storage, file transfer, sync or PC suite.Viewing / listening to media content is an amazing experience. The interface is easy and intuitive thanks to dedicated buttons, and the sound quality is unprecedented. However, getting your contents to your phone is another pair of shoes.While the PC suite is an excellent peace of work, the software for Mac looks and feels poor. It all seems like sugar and cream for you PC guys out there, but what about us, the Mac users? Well, it's not that we're not taken into consideration, far from that. However, serious improvements are yet to be made issuing Mac-Sony Ericsson friendship. What you get on the Sony Ericsson web site is an iSync plugin (available only recently), allowing you to sync your contacts, tasks, and calendars between W995 and your Mac. And MediaSync, which is, or should be, the equivalent of MediaGo. The truth is, it allows you to transfer music and podcasts, but not the videos. Kind of sad. The good side is that it works well with iTunes library, and manages your music and podcasts flawlessly. Yet transferring videos between a Mac and your W995 still remains an issue. There are ways around, but they don't always work.On the iSync level, things are not shining either. With the older version of iSync plugin, the synchronizing process was fairly time consuming since it was not incremental. That means that every time you want to synchronize your contacts, tasks and calendars, it completely replaces the entire content. This was soon fixed by an updated plugin, so now it takes far less time. Furthermore, it crippled my address book since the two databases are still far from compatible.However, this all shows that Sony Ericsson is still pioneering in the Mac compatibility field, and hopefully these issues will be addressed in the upcoming versions of firmware. What I do like about the Sony Ericsson bluetooth syncing is that you can enable it to always accept demands from known devices. That way you no longer have to frenetically look for your device (pocket? desk? handbag? quick!), each time iSync starts. Just make sure it's within the bluetooth range, and you're in sync, with no annoying dialogues around.Another annoying thing about this product is the lack of support for certain character formats. So when you receive an email written in say croatian keyboard layout, instead of the actual content, it displays a ""unknown character set"" message. So it's clear to see that W995 is still pretty much an unfinished product, from the firmware developing standpoint.And now to camera! I had no special demands on my phone's camera, so I completely forgot about it. But when I got to play with it, I found that it's not bad at all. In fact, it's a 8,1MP camera with autofocus, flash, face and smile recognition, and loads of other features from the k-series! And the picture quality is awesome! Holy cow! The down side is that the picture quality suffers dramatically in low light conditions: the colors fade or go crazy, contours mix up, and a huge amount of noise takes away all the pleasure. So you can either try to save it in an image editing software or just be honest and conclude that the pic sucks. Up to you :)So the bottom line is: shot on sun, and keep the good impression. Another interesting thing about the camera is a dedicated shutter button. Very nice feature. However, it can also be a problem at times. You see, when you want to take a picture, first you need to press the shutter button halfway down, to allow the autofocus to find objects you presumably want to sharpen up. The process takes up to 5 seconds, after which you get this annoying beep, meaning: Now you can press the button all the way down. Yeah, right. Your object is by than far away from the frame, the kids are no longer smiling, and the dog just knocked off chasing his tale. This can be particularly annoying when asking someone to take a picture of you.Last but not the least: the build quality. Though the phone is solid and feels expensive, my recommendation is to pay attention to scratches and bruises. The chassis is extremely sensitive to scratches, and I recommend buying a screen cover and a some kind of protective case right away. The Sony Ericsson logo is subject to damage as well as the ""W995"" sign, since both are no other but stickers and tend to peel off with the time.All in all, an excellent phone, but the competition in its price range is stiff. Some software issues remain loose ends, but they'll probably get ironed up.the GOOD:-features (big)-camera (despite all the odds)-3.5 audio jack-unprecedented media experience-usb charged battery-intuitive interface-DLNA (haven't tested it though)-sliding mechanism-attention to detailsthe BAD-poor Mac compatibility-poor build quality of the chassis-lack of character support for many languages in default email app-kickstand feels clumsy-WLAN doesn't work in some hotspots-lack of search storage capability-browsing through address book feels like the year 2000-other small imperfections in firmware",1

It would have got 5-Star rating if not for the 3 design flaws with the phone.1. Kick Stand design can't be any worse. It is not firmly stuck in closed position. If Sony Ericsson couldn't get it right they should have skipped this hardware. It would have saved them money and made the phone feel more solid.2. Battery cover - like others said in the review doesn't feel firm. You can feel slight movement when you press fingers around the Sony Ericsson name on the back. It feels little annoying to see a well built phone choke on battery cover design. I first thought I got a bad phone and thought of exchanging it but after reading reviews here and other forums it looks like a pretty common not with just this phone but several SE phones. I put a paper folded above the battery and it solved this problem.3. The Call Button and End Call buttons are not positioned ergonomically. They are located little too far from the D-pad and it hurts the fingers to reach them from center.Good things about the phone:1. Looks way better than in pictures and is getting lot of compliments from everyone who sees the phone.2. Feels solid and super sexy. Easily the best slider phone I've seen.3. Bright screen and very readable even in bright sunlight.4. Came with lot of games, applications, and 8GB Memory Stick Micro.5. GPS reception, AT&T 3G connection, WiFi connection - all are very good.6. First time I saw a 3.5mm audio output which is a great plus for me as I have several good headphones I can use.7. To compliment the 3.5mm audio output, this phone easily replaces my Zune 8GB during my workout sessions. Sounds just as good.8. The flash themes are very very good looking.9. Battery felt average the first few weeks but seem to have improved greatly after few weeks. I am heavy user of browser, office outlook emails, calendar, and songs listener and the phone easily lasts the entire day even after I talk on average over 60+ minutes.10. Works with my office Exchange Server to sync Outlook Email and Calendar as well as my Google mail.Amazon has the best price for this phone.TIP for W995a owners: Install Opera Mini 5 beta. The browsing experience is excellent with small fonts.",7

I love this phone more than an iphone that every other person in the world has. HAPPY that it came with the 8GB M2 card cause my previous Sony Ericsson I had to buy. This is just the greatest phone I have ever bought!!!,1
"Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",Sony,269.1,3,"I purchased this phone from Amazon a week ago, after researching for over a month looking to replace my classic iPhone 16GB. I was looking for an unlocked multimedia phone and was leaning towards the Nokia N85. I have to say that while most reviews out there favor the Nokia, I cave into the looks of the W995a. Someone at Cnet said it is not the sexiest phone around, but I beg to differ, the phone is very sleek, the slider mechanism is flawless and the overall presentation of the hardware is much higher end that any of the new (available) Nokias I've seen. It is slimmer that the N85, and the brushed metal case is very elegant and looks way better than the plastic on the mentioned Nokia handset.It should be noted, as mentioned by other reviewers, that this is not a smartphone, meaning that there is limited customization and most of the applications you get are web based, a la iPhone two years ago. Since this phone is unlocked (something I really desired, and the main reason I did not upgrade my iPhone) you have to play around with the settings a little bit to get the most out of the features of this phone. For instance, I had a hard time figuring out how to get it to stream videos over the YouTube application that comes as part of the media interface. I have MediaNet (EDGE) service from AT&T and was not able to stream any video. Then I discovered that if you turn off the WiFi you will get it, though a bit chopped since EDGE is not the best for video streaming. That being said, I still have to figure out how to get it to stream over WiFi, which should be much better. Oddly, most reviewers elsewhere had the opposite problem: they were able to stream over WiFi but could not get it to stream over EDGE. The workaround for the WiFi problem seems to be opening extra ports on your wireless router, something I am completely illiterate on. So this is a major drawback of the phone: for a phone that is claimed to be the flagship multimedia device from SE, all these bugs and problems should not be present, especially at this price range. Not being able to access YouTube properly is just unacceptable. Paying customers should not have to waste time trying to figure out things engineers and technicians at SE get paid to do. If you go to the SE webpage and look for support for this device you will be able to get the settings sent to your phone for proper web navigation, email and picture messaging... but nothing for the video streaming problem.This phone comes with an 8.1 MP camera with single LED flash. The pictures outdoors with good natural light are OK, but things get much worse indoors or with limited light. If you already have a nice point and shoot, this phone won't replace it. If you are looking for a new phone and to upgrade an old point and shoot, then maybe this phone will save you some bucks. Don't get me wrong, the camera is very good, it's just that reading 8.1 MP on the specs creates very high expectations.The real treat of this phone comes from the music player. The sound is just amazing. I did not know how much sound quality I was sacrificing with my iPhone and iPods until I listened to the music player in this phone: I was blown away. It should also be mentioned that the phone comes equipped with FM radio, which is actually very nice. The bundled Media Go software serves as an iTunes-like application to manage all your media files on your phone. It has a drag and drop interface that makes easy to add any songs, videos or photos to your phone, and guess what? Also from your phone to your computer (take that iPhone!). As any new piece of software, Media Go is not without flaws. When transferring songs from my library into my phone I received many error messages about unsuccessful transfers. I was able to go back and fix some of those but sometimes there were so many that it was hard to keep track (the program puts a check next to all successful transfers but puts no visual indication whatsoever next to the unsuccessful ones). It also failed to display some of my iTunes artwork. However, if you already use iTunes as your music player and media organizing program, MediaGo will easily import everything from your iTunes folder. Another important caveat is that updating your phone's firmware erases the phone's internal memory (not the memory card or the SIM card), so it is important to back up your phone using the SE PC Suite before every update.Call quality is just OK. It can get pretty bad in noisy environments, e.g. supermarket. Google maps works great. So, to sum up, if you are looking for a great-looking phone with a superb music player, OK video player, and OK camera and do not want to sign up for a 2-year bleed-out contract, you should definitely consider the W995a.UPDATE (After 3 months with the phone): So even though the media Go experience hasn't been the best, I was happy overall with the phone. That is until today when I updated the firmware. I backed up the phone as recommended, and followed all the instructions. Then, after the update I restored my phone using my backup. The contacts failed to restore and now I have lost all my contacts, but what is worse, all the customizations I had for some of them, i.e., ringtones and photos. Not only that, but about half the music and all the videos I had in the memory card got erased, which was not supposed to happen, since only the phone memory is supposed to be cleaned during the firmware update. All these things are just unacceptable for a cell phone this expensive. I never had such problems with my old iPhone. I will try to get rid of this phone as soon as possible and go back to Apple's boring but reliable products.",4

"Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",Sony,269.1,3,"This phone is unbranded (meaning you cannot get it from your local at&t or T-Mobile store here in the U.S.) So since the phone is unbranded forget about customer service help from your wireless carrier. All they tell you is contact Sony Ericsson. When you call Sony Ericsson customer service, they're very arrogant, and all they try to do is to let you use their support page on their website.The phone is good looking and solid, however many reviewers in other places [...] have returned their phone due to faulty battery cover that wobbles, and the kickstand is loose and doesn't stay in place. Unfortunately these problem occurs when your 30 days are up and you cannot return your product for a full refund!SE claims a 8.1 megapixel camera, but that is far from taking great pictures, at best their okay!The case IC-45 that SE offers for the phone is generic (meaning not specially made for this model) and when you put the phone in there the latch doesn't close and you have to force it. Forcing it touches the off button and your phone is off without you knowing it. The belt case is made of plastic that is very hard to use and that it can break easily!The GPS program that come pre-installed is Wayfinder, and it's a European company not even comparable to Tomtom, Garmin. Telenav doesn't offer a program for this specific model and their CS is another story.So basically you're paying for a great looking phone without any support from your carrier and SE.The music player (Walkman) is great and sounds great! Youtube application doesn't work, you have to mess with the firmware and it's not recommended for none tech savvy people! (this is where you find that at&t doesn't care since it's not their branded phone and SE doesn't care since they really don't care after they sell you the device, and they tell you you should contact your carrier!).So, bottom line if you're tech savvy, you have $450+ to burn, and you change phone often then yes buy this phone by all mean. However if you want tech support, cheaper phone, buy a branded version from your own wireless carrier.[...]",5
"Sony Ericsson W995a Walkman Unlocked Phone with 3G, 8.1 MP, WiFi, Stereo Bluetooth, and Assisted GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Progressive Black)",Sony,269.1,4,"I decided to purchase the w995a after carefully researching some viable alternatives such as the Nokia n86 8mp, the still-good and underrated n96, and the n82. I chose the Sony because it looks and feels better than the other phones, not because it IS better than the others. Let me explain.This phone is absolutely gorgeous. Its made of brushed metal, it feels amazing in your hand, and the sliding mechanism is nearly perfect. It's a feature phone, so you really don't have any options to customize the UI like you would with a symbian phone (i.e. the nokias mentioned above), but if this doesn't bother you (which it did not bother me), it really won't matter because the menu layout is really perfect and intuitive. It has great sound, it's beautiful when lit up, and the call quality is superb. That being said, it's simply not a ""better"" phone than the nokias I've listed.For one, the camera is simply ""ok."" Shots taken indoors will disappoint you, while those taken outdoors look very good. The video recording is old-school at 30fps QVGA while the nokias mentioned record DVD quality video at 30fps in VGA. Not to mention the nokias have carl ziess optics (regarded as one of the best lense makers in the world).I decided not to go with the Nokia N86, it's ""closest"" competitor. The N86 is a better phone, it has an 8gb hard drive while the w995a comes with an 8gb card. The nokia can be expanded with up to a 16gb card, has a variable aperture 8mp that takes exquisite photos, and has the ever- customizable symbian UI. But its ugly, and plastic; typical Nokia.So, to sum it up:THE GOOD:-beautiful-well built-beautiful interface-good pictures-excellent media player-best sliding mech. everTHE BAD:-other phones in its price range are arguable better-should take great pictures, not good ones-video recording is 2004-era phone-has a TFT 256k screen, while all others in its price range have AMOLED 16M screens.It was a tough choice, but for me, the look and feel of this one took the cake!",33

So if you have the same problem with the older android version upgrade to newest and the popping it will stop. Also i will recomend to avoid open wi-fi sources that you don't trust and sites that they can put cokies and malwares into your phone and install a good antivirus for full protection I am giving 3 stars because the issue that i have now is that after i am using my mobile data it is becoming slow and i have to restart it, and the battery it lasts less than a day, but after all i am happy that i am having my phone back.",2

You can find thousands of people on internet who are facing the same issue. The phone is useless and the seller has washed his hands off by not providing any US warranty. If I talk to Sony customer service, they tell me that this is not a US phone and so they can't do anything about it. Why is the seller selling a defective product in the first place?

Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,5,I bought this phone for the game element only. After receiving it I got it set up in under an hour using wi-fi only.

Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,4,"I got one of these just for $#!*$ & giggles, not too shabby!Sony xperia build quality impresses. The phone is not as largeas it looks on one of the original ads (girl must have had atiny hand lol ) the slide mechanism is a little slippery butsolid.As a game device, it's a bit underpowered, but this doesn'tseem to slow it down! Played all games i tried perfectly!Have yet to try it as a phone, wifi only so far.Gingerbread kinda stale by now but, NO ICS for the play.Sony cites instability issues that would compromise thePlay's core strength, GAMING.Custom roms around thought (rooted only, I did root only)The ergonomics of the phone are pretty good too.The slideout PS controller works great, even the ""Digilogs""?and the device as a whole doesn't feel to clunky in the hand.Only cons are the slippery slideout hinge and the overallGlossiness, which makes it a fingerprint magnet for usgreasballs...lol also wish the white was available toUSA carriers.Edit: UPDATEHaving had the phone for a bit longer I can say that in the openposition the phone is somewhat uncomfortable to hold for longperiods. I have average hands (large) slender and the slide outcontroller feels...to thin, and a bit smallish, leading to handfatigue fairly quick. The L & R shoulder buttons are difficult tomaintain your fingers at, while the touchpads feel to closetogether.Also the power/standby button is pathetically small, a smallsliver really. Sure you can use the menu buttons to wake thephone but eventually you need to use the power/standby buttonand it's tiny...But the phone really is a fun devise even just for gaming.Plus not being massive makes it a decent handset as well.",25

Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,4,"Great phone, but the hard drive is pathetically small. An SD card is a must, and even then installed programs tend to need to be on the phone itself, unless you root the phone.

Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,1,"he product arrived in perfect condition, but to my frustration came with the CDMA technology that is not used in Brazil, this only works with GSM cellular technology. The mobile this useless, to make matters worse I was taxed in Brazil on 60% of what made the expensive product. The suggestion I make is for the amazon review is a way for your clients are not taxed, sending its products with a lower value in their notes.",

Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,2,"We got this phone to replace the original Xperia Play we had and dropped, thus cracking the screen. This phone shuts off whenever it wants to, alarm only works when it decides it wants, and it sometimes goes black and vibrates on it's own.

Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,3,"The phone itself compared to any other for the purpose of reception, sound, and phone storage is not that good.For games pretty good. Unfortunately most games involve touch screen operation so the control itself is redundant at times.I haven't really spent much time looking for games that work with the slide-out pad, as i got the phone for my kids to play with.All in all this phone is a novelty and was only made by apple and verizon for a few years because of it probably.Kinda' cool though. You can most likely find this phone used for 40-50 bucks where a psvita or 3ds will run you 125-150 used and have a much faster wi-fi and internet process speed, larger and clearer display. I don't know do the math.",0

After I started the phone up, I found that the touch screen had been horribly misaligned, rendering the phone virtually useless. They should have told me the phone was ""refurbished"" (badly, at that) before sending me a defective product. It's a great phone, but I would recommend finding a different seller.",
Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,5,"I bought this not to use it as a phone, but strictly for game emulation. Using legally obtained ROMs and a number of pieces of emulation software, this thing is a powerhouse for reliving some of gaming's greatest moments. It may not run Jelly Bean, but Android 2.3 was totally serviceable, and lots of apps on the Google Play store work on it still. My only criticism is I wish the screen was brighter. That's it though.Money well spent!",4

Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,5,"I can't comment on this as a phone, as I don't have Verizon service. I bought it solely as a portable gaming device, for emulators specifically.

Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,5,I purchased this phone for my teenage son who selected this phone due to the gaming keypad. He loves the phone! Only issue is that the case he bought doesn't allow for use of one of the side buttons so he is not using a protective case. The phone was a good value on Amazon and I'd recommend the phone and this seller.,

Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,3,"For the first week i loved the phone. had no issues or anything other than it being stuck in roaming mode. i got the phone to play games and see how everything was over wifi before getting the phone turned on. but after having the phone for about 2 weeks, i have had it randomly crash on some of the apps that came on the phone. or completely stop responding. and just a few hours ago i unplugged it from charging and every 10 seconds (while the screen was off) the phone would light up for 3 seconds then go off.. it kept doing it. which would frustrate people who want the battery to stay alive while at work. so i turned the phone off and back on and that issue is gone. the battery life is really good compared to other androids. but honestly i have played for probably 5-7 hours on and off through out a day and it was still at 38 percent. i just kept the screen brightness down. so really i love the phone but it has some glitches. could be the android 2.4.2 which i haven't updated yet because it wont update while roaming even though it is only roaming i believe because i haven't had it connected to verizon yet. but remember this is my experience. if i update the phone im sure the glitches will go away or be less of them.",
Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY Android Phone (Verizon Wireless),Sony,599.99,5,i bought it to flash it over to Cricket. Everything still works on it except of course the verizon stuff. i mainly use it to play PS1 and SNES games,5

The moment I opened it after receiving it in the mail, I found the port door missing. How could have Sony missed this detail? What kind of Quality Control did Sony implement on this so-called flagship model? I was actually more amazed that annoyed by this and I did not even bother to turn on the phone. Good thing I bought it from Amazon which graciously accepted my return as a defective product. Thanks, Amazon. Wake up, Sony.",2

Sony Xperia Acro S LT26W Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black),Sony,330.4,2,"After a few months playing with this phone i realize the water proof feature is the only thing going for this phone . Speaker phone volume is way too low , No removable battery ,but i knew that just didnt think it would be a pain in the rear when the phone freezes ,and it will freeze from time to time you can bet on that .I spent $100 on a Galaxy s3 from at&t after rooting and installing custom os the Galaxy was clearly the better phone even before i rooted it . At&t will recognize unlocked smart phones now so your going to pay the smartphone fee anyway might as well enjoy a better phone . Screen not as clear as one would think but still very clear . Kind of clunky in the hand maybe due to the sharp edges not being rounded or the back not being curved .If the phone goes dead from needing to be charged , when plugged in the phone turns on and off without charging over and over again until you get the phone turned on then plug the charger in , I have no clue whats up with that but i have an older SE Xperia Neo that does the same thing . NFC is only compatible with other Sony's so thats kinda worthless.I do like the water proof feature but thats about where it ends i have been a loyal Sony/ Ericsson customer since the SE 790a. I think im about done with Sony until they fix that annoying charging problem, start using removable batteries and turn up the WORTHLESS speakerphone .APN settings you will need to input manually , the auto settings loaded into the phone via setup wizard for AT&T are incorrect and will cause the internet connection to go in and out . Not a big issue just do a Google search for at&t apn settings and you will find the correct settings.Battery life - You will need to plug the phone up at least once during the day from a full charge in the morning or it will be ready to die by early afternoon.Screen display is NOT gorilla glass! Sony uses a scratch resistant mineral glass so get a screen protector period ! I am very careful with my phones but i am starting to see small scratches in the screen . My 3 year old Nokia with Gorilla glass has no scratches and has never had a screen protector.Volume rocker is in a terrible spot you will wonder why Sony did this every time you need to turn the volume up or down.Reception is great i get a good signal almost everywhere without issue .Call quality is good but you will understand very quickly why i use my bluetooth headset all the time .Phone froze the first week with a full charge and i didnt know what to do so i called Sony for help. Sony quickly answered and instructed me how to do a reset . Press & hold power + volume up until it resets and it was fine after that .Anyway you have been warned .",0

Sony Xperia Acro S LT26W Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Black),Sony,330.4,5,"I purchased this device primarily as a replacement for my subsidized Motorola Droid 2 Global. That device is off contract this month, and was looking for an unlocked GSM-Based device that I could run on Straighttalk or similar service in the US. Important features for me were as follows:Unlocked GSM serviceUnlockable bootloader for potential customizationUSB OTGHigh quality displayHigh quality cameraBattery lifeSome sense of ruggednessI would say that it has lived up to my expectations thus far. I love the Camera. With average use, I am getting a bit more than a day out of the battery. Sony needs to be commended on their approach to open development platforms. They did provide the unlock code for the boot loader within the hour I requested it. The skin they provide to the Android OS is lightweight by default. While some feel the specs of this device are a bit behind, it has handled anything I have thrown at it. The software runs well and I am please with the performance. No lag or general slowdowns observed yet.While I like the device, it may not be for everyone. I have larger hands and some people may feel the device it a little thicker. I think that mostly has to do with IP57 water proof rating. One complaint that I would have is that the waterproof doors do get in the way and are a tad annoying for any wireless peripherals, including headphones. Luckily I have a nice bluetooth stereo headset. Another item which could be considered a con, is that the volume rocker is lower than it might otherwise be.Everyone should also be aware that this phone is not yet compatible with TMobile's (or there MVNO's) 3G networks in most US locales. I hear that T Mobile is in the process of migrating their 3G HSPA networks to the standard frequencies this device supports within the year. Otherwise you would be stuck to 2G rates for data.Overall I would recommend this device to most people. It has a premium feel and feature-set without the price tag of a premium unlocked device. Between the display, camera, and what this device can save me a month (prepaid services around $50/Month). It will pay for itself rather quickly.",0

It offers many good features for a relatively low price. On the other hand, I like the sophisticated appearance of this device, it is sober and simple but shows a nice style at the same time. It does not have a great storage capacity (2 GB) but you are able to increase the memory with a Micro sim memory, which is not really expensive. For, me it is fast enough, altough it may not be fast enough for people that like to have many applications ON at the same time, if you only need about 4 ""big"" applications on, like facebook, twitter, wassapp and gmail, it would work well.",2

Good speaker, OK screen, OK camera, great battery life. Not the fastest but I suspect it is more than enough for the average user. I tested data speed while tethering this phone to a PC and it clocks at 3.6mbs. That is almost the same as my Samsung 4G that cost 4 times more. The Bluetooth works much better than other phones I have had with great sound through my car stereo.

Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink),Sony,189.99,2,"Pros:* Compact size* Soft-touch plastic back is relatively non-slip* Low price point* No problems with audio quality or call connectivityCons:* Not enough storage for apps* Inadequate processing power and/or insufficient RAM (slow)* Camera is borderline useless* Low screen resolution* Sony ""Xperia"" value-add is underwhelmingThis was my first smartphone purchase and I wanted something compact, unlocked, and relatively inexpensive. I've had the Xperia E for several months now, and in retrospect I should have paid-up for more memory and processing power. This is a classic example of ""you get what you pay for."" The phone can be infuriatingly slow to respond, even to actions as seemingly simple as unlocking the screen with a PIN. The screen resolution is too low for some apps, making them difficult to use. The camera is only good for capturing still subjects in daylight.By far the most annoying feature of this phone is its small internal flash memory. 2GB seemed like it would be enough when I was shopping, since I had no intention of loading a bunch of media on it. Little did I know that only about 750MB is allocated to so-called ""phone memory,"" which is where most apps are stored. This severely limits my ability to install much beyond than the preloaded apps on the phone. Some apps can be moved to ""internal storage,"" and I have managed to uninstall / un-update some of the preloaded apps. Nevertheless, updating large apps such as Chrome is often a tedious process of clearing caches and temporarily uninstalling other apps in order to free enough storage perform the update. I'm sure with enough time and effort I could find a solution in some Android forum. Those who expect things to ""just work"" should move on.",8

The instructions received with it were very basic so I did have to go online for more info, which I found easily. I can now read my emails and check out Facebook. I play golf and the weather app. is perfect for letting me know what to expect. There was a software update to be done which was straightforward to carry out.Love this phone and would recommend it.

Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink),Sony,189.99,4,"I love my SONY. I have sony pretty much everything for my consumer electronics, and though this is not as sexy as my Xperia SL, it is plenty to be satisfied with where it's priced at. Deduct a star for the tiny screen & the bit outdated android & 3G. Otherwise, love it. :D",6
Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink),Sony,189.99,3,"swipe function is not that smart, no front camera, setting is confusing, touch screen not very sensitive, long lasting battery",2
Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink),Sony,189.99,3,"I bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Y, which is not a bad phone but I kept running out of space on the actual phone. Even putting a 32gb sd card didn't help. It only has 128mb on the phone. Also the old phone had such a small screen that some things got cut off. Enough about my old phone. This new phone, this Sony phone, is great. Although does have some minor things that might get on my nerves. The main issue is that when you send texts and I automatically get a reply about message being relayed. Which was not an issue on the old phone but when doing a google on it. I found some black berries also having that issue with the same phone service that I have. it sounds like that is not something you can change at least nothing I can find says how to change that. I don't mind it being relayed I just don't want to be notified. Another issue is email notifications do not always work. I mean email works it just does not always seem to notify you. The gmail notifications do work. I did a google on that one as well and actually found some one talking about sony xperia but not this one, an older one. I am not sure which one he was talking about but he had this same issue and could not find a fix for it. He also suggested getting the Samsung Galaxy S3. I would get one of those but they are a lot more money then this phone.Any way I do like this phone even with the minor issues listed above. Oh wait I just remembered another issue that is not a major one either. This new phone does not work with my FM transmitter. I have no idea why either as it uses a standard head phone jack to connect to the phone. Any way again I do like the phone and I like that things are not cut off and I am not longer running out of room on the phone.Update to this review. I now give it 3 stars instead of 4. Main reason. Some times it will lock up and you have to remove the battery as none of the buttons work to get it to come back on correctly. It is a pain to remove the battery as well. Another issue is when the phone restarts either after pulling the battery or just restarting it. The phone comes back on and starts making random sounds. This is not my rington nor does it stop after a while. The first time it did this the thing made random sounds for almost an hour. I was on the other phone so could not pull my attention to trying to get it to stop instead I just covered it until I was off the other phone. I can stop it by swiping from the top to the bottom and hitting clear even if there is nothing to clear. This stops it. I have yet to figure out what causes this or why.",35

Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink),Sony,189.99,3,"This phone is ok, main issue is it does not have enough internal memory if you are running several apps...I downloaded a few apps, and already running out of internal memory..However, for the price is a good phone if you just want the super basic phone..I'm using this phone as a temporary phone... until the new models come out in August..I used to have a Nexus 4, but I dropped it while getting out of the car and the screen broke, so I had to get a new phone in a hurry, this one seemed to meet the budget... I tried it, everything works, but it is way slower in processing speed than the $350 nexus phone.. its a neat little nice designed phone, but lacks processing speed and memory... compared to the more expensive phones...its good phone for a back up phone.. but if you are a techy person and looking at pictures online and facebook, then maybe its best to upgrade to a more memory and faster processing chip... I guess you get what you pay for... but its really cheap at $100... so I guess I can't complain... the screen is slightly small too... but size wise the phone fits well in my pocket..",0

Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink),Sony,189.99,1,"Update 09/09/2014: I have had this phone for about a year now and it's f*ing HORRIBLE. It was alright at first, but it went down hill fast and hard!! I had to delete 90% of my apps b/c my phone keeps running out of memory. I take pictures on a rare occasion if I need to document something for work. Other than that, it just keeps somehow running out of room. I don't update it anymore b/c that takes up memory. It freezes up a few times a week. Sometimes It freezes WHEN MY ALARM IS GOING OFF!! So I have to take off my phone case and remove the battery. Very infuriating when you're just waking up. There's a lot of lag on the phone. Yes this phone may be cheap, but trust me when I say save your money. Buy a cheap, non-smart, nokia phone and save up your money for an actual good smart phone. As for this phone, BEWARE and STAY AWAY. If you do buy it, a few months later don't say I didn't warn you. . .Previous Review: February 26, 2014:The phone works (I'm stationed in Italy). I'm able to put a european sim card in it with no problem. It's not the best phone out there, but it works as a good smart phone. I only have a short time left on my tour and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on great smart phone (ie. galaxy S5 or Note 3), so I wanted to get a budget smart phone for internet usage.pros:-responsive touch screen-decent speed-SD card slot available for extra memory-great speakers-has most features you find on any smart phone-checking fb, email, bank accounts, etc runs smooth.cons:-low quality camera with no focus-decent speed-not a lot of internal memory-reception is ehh inside certain facilitiesAll in all, it's a great smartphone for someone on a budget. I've had better and worse. So if you're looking for a temp phone for not too much money, this is it.",6
Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink),Sony,189.99,1,"I'd probably love this phone but the truth is it is now a pain and burden after loosing money on it. Yea, I said it.

Anyway, when opened the phone up I found the four main silver phillips screws stripped. Selling me a referbished phone at close to market value, good on you.

Display is horrible...when you just turn on the phone the graphics that appear look great...nice, clear and crisp...but when the icons load they all look fuzzy..far from looking clear and crisp. The phone does not have much internal storage...download a few updates and you can't even download a small game on the phone.

Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink),Sony,189.99,3,"I popped my GoPhone (AT&T) SIM with the $35 plan into this when I got it and it worked right off the bat, no issues whatsoever. I opted to turn off data and simply use wifi for all of my internet needs. The only problem I had upon unboxing it was figuring out how to get the battery cover off, as the instructions are mostly just pictures and not very descriptive - I figured out that what you do is simply put your thumbs above the little speaker on the back and push up.People who are used to more powerful, more expensive phones might be a little disappointed. I previously had a phone that ran Android 2.2 and really wanted a phone that would support my credit union's app which allows me to take pictures of checks to deposit them (otherwise I have to drive 2+ hours) and this phone does that perfectly, even with the low-grade camera.I love the ""swiping"" option with the keyboard, I find it to be much easier to text that way, especially if I need to text with one hand. (No, not while driving).UPDATE 8/31/14: I had to knock off a couple points after having this phone for awhile. It lags and freezes up a lot. It will freeze, the screen will lock after 30 seconds, and then it will just not respond for awhile. You either have to pop the battery out and completely restart it or wait for it to get itself together. Certain apps seem to be the cause. Snapchat and Vine have so far been unsuccessful for me, they don't record video and cause the phone to freeze. Shazam works but takes FOREVER and sometimes causes the phone to freeze. A lot of games that I've downloaded are also pretty much unplayable due to the lagging, like Dots, Piano Tiles, and Temple Run. The Walkman app sometimes locks up too, it won't stop playing music but just won't respond when you press buttons.Apps that I have NOT had a problem with on this phone are Facebook, Pinterest, Pandora, Tumblr, Facebook Messenger, Indeed, Dropbox, Discover Mobile, Opera Mini, and Google Maps. I have to say, this phone is incredibly reliable when using it as a GPS with Google Maps.The microphone on the phone also stopped working for me this summer. I don't know if other people have had any issues with that, but I didn't take any points off because it's hard to tell if it was caused by something I did or not. I have gotten the phone wet and dropped it before. At first I just sounded really far away to people and then they weren't able to hear me at all and would just hang up on me. Now the only way I can make calls is with the headset, which, on the bright side, works great.Overall, I think there are other phones out there at this price that probably perform better.",

Good speaker, OK screen, OK camera, great battery life. Not the fastest but I suspect it is more than enough for the average user.

I've had the Xperia E for several months now, and in retrospect I should have paid-up for more memory and processing power. This is a classic example of ""you get what you pay for."" The phone can be infuriatingly slow to respond, even to actions as seemingly simple as unlocking the screen with a PIN. The screen resolution is too low for some apps, making them difficult to use. The camera is only good for capturing still subjects in daylight.By far the most annoying feature of this phone is its small internal flash memory. 2GB seemed like it would be enough when I was shopping, since I had no intention of loading a bunch of media on it. Little did I know that only about 750MB is allocated to so-called ""phone memory,"" which is where most apps are stored. This severely limits my ability to install much beyond than the preloaded apps on the phone. Some apps can be moved to ""internal storage,"" and I have managed to uninstall / un-update some of the preloaded apps. Nevertheless, updating large apps such as Chrome is often a tedious process of clearing caches and temporarily uninstalling other apps in order to free enough storage perform the update. I'm sure with enough time and effort I could find a solution in some Android forum. Those who expect things to ""just work"" should move on.",8

Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink),Sony,189.99,3,"I bought this phone last winter. It has survived numerous drops, even though it is small and not too thick (I bought a case for it on Amazon a few month ago though). I use this phone mainly for leisure purposes. You can install most of the apps from Google Play. It only has a 3.2 MP camera, so don't expect to take spectacular photos. It does take nice pictures in the day or with lots of light.My main issues: If you don't close out unused apps, the phone slows down significantly. It can just be one other app and it starts to crawl. On two different occasions, the phone erased my songs and pictures. They were sent to lost.dir and I had to manually rename each picture and song on my computer and then put them back on the phone. Some of the pictures were damaged and were permanently lost. The headphones that came with the phone didn't last long. I've tried several headphones, but the phone doesn't recognize most of them.If it wasn't for the phone surviving drops without cracking, I would have gave it a much lower rating.",

Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White),Sony,34.99,3,"swipe function is not that smart, no front camera, setting is confusing, touch screen not very sensitive, long lasting battery",2
Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White),Sony,34.99,3,"I bought this to replace my Samsung Galaxy Y, which is not a bad phone but I kept running out of space on the actual phone. Even putting a 32gb sd card didn't help. It only has 128mb on the phone. Also the old phone had such a small screen that some things got cut off. Enough about my old phone. This new phone, this Sony phone, is great. Although does have some minor things that might get on my nerves. The main issue is that when you send texts and I automatically get a reply about message being relayed. Which was not an issue on the old phone but when doing a google on it. I found some black berries also having that issue with the same phone service that I have. it sounds like that is not something you can change at least nothing I can find says how to change that. I don't mind it being relayed I just don't want to be notified. Another issue is email notifications do not always work. I mean email works it just does not always seem to notify you. The gmail notifications do work. I did a google on that one as well and actually found some one talking about sony xperia but not this one, an older one. I am not sure which one he was talking about but he had this same issue and could not find a fix for it. He also suggested getting the Samsung Galaxy S3. I would get one of those but they are a lot more money then this phone.Any way I do like this phone even with the minor issues listed above. Oh wait I just remembered another issue that is not a major one either. This new phone does not work with my FM transmitter. I have no idea why either as it uses a standard head phone jack to connect to the phone. Any way again I do like the phone and I like that things are not cut off and I am not longer running out of room on the phone.Update to this review. I now give it 3 stars instead of 4. Main reason. Some times it will lock up and you have to remove the battery as none of the buttons work to get it to come back on correctly. It is a pain to remove the battery as well. Another issue is when the phone restarts either after pulling the battery or just restarting it. The phone comes back on and starts making random sounds. This is not my rington nor does it stop after a while. The first time it did this the thing made random sounds for almost an hour. I was on the other phone so could not pull my attention to trying to get it to stop instead I just covered it until I was off the other phone. I can stop it by swiping from the top to the bottom and hitting clear even if there is nothing to clear. This stops it. I have yet to figure out what causes this or why.",35

Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White),Sony,34.99,1,"Update 09/09/2014: I have had this phone for about a year now and it's f*ing HORRIBLE. It was alright at first, but it went down hill fast and hard!! I had to delete 90% of my apps b/c my phone keeps running out of memory. I take pictures on a rare occasion if I need to document something for work. Other than that, it just keeps somehow running out of room. I don't update it anymore b/c that takes up memory. It freezes up a few times a week. Sometimes It freezes WHEN MY ALARM IS GOING OFF!! So I have to take off my phone case and remove the battery. Very infuriating when you're just waking up. There's a lot of lag on the phone. Yes this phone may be cheap, but trust me when I say save your money. Buy a cheap, non-smart, nokia phone and save up your money for an actual good smart phone. As for this phone, BEWARE and STAY AWAY. If you do buy it, a few months later don't say I didn't warn you. . .Previous Review: February 26, 2014:The phone works (I'm stationed in Italy). I'm able to put a european sim card in it with no problem. It's not the best phone out there, but it works as a good smart phone. I only have a short time left on my tour and I didn't want to spend a lot of money on great smart phone (ie. galaxy S5 or Note 3), so I wanted to get a budget smart phone for internet usage.pros:-responsive touch screen-decent speed-SD card slot available for extra memory-great speakers-has most features you find on any smart phone-checking fb, email, bank accounts, etc runs smooth.cons:-low quality camera with no focus-decent speed-not a lot of internal memory-reception is ehh inside certain facilitiesAll in all, it's a great smartphone for someone on a budget. I've had better and worse. So if you're looking for a temp phone for not too much money, this is it.",6

It has survived numerous drops, even though it is small and not too thick (I bought a case for it on Amazon a few month ago though). I use this phone mainly for leisure purposes. You can install most of the apps from Google Play. It only has a 3.2 MP camera, so don't expect to take spectacular photos. It does take nice pictures in the day or with lots of light.My main issues: If you don't close out unused apps, the phone slows down significantly. It can just be one other app and it starts to crawl. On two different occasions, the phone erased my songs and pictures. They were sent to lost.dir and I had to manually rename each picture and song on my computer and then put them back on the phone. Some of the pictures were damaged and were permanently lost. The headphones that came with the phone didn't last long. I've tried several headphones, but the phone doesn't recognize most of them.If it wasn't for the phone surviving drops without cracking, I would have gave it a much lower rating.",1

I use it with Go-Phone on a pay-as-you-go plan. The phone functions are great. The radio and music players are very good sound quality. The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used. There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed. Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there. Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability. I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use. I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts. Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident. The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response. The phone does have a few quirks. There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell. The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off. The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though. All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly.",1

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,4,"First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk.",12

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,5,"This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3. It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard. The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited.",17

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,299,2,"Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone. Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty. I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue. Now for the phone review.Pros: The phone has a great keyboard. If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard. The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways. The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color. The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels. For e-mail it's adequate.Cons: I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone. The onboard social network apps are not fully functional. You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so. The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them. Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store. The browser was mediocre, barely passable. Also, NO GPS for this phone. Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength. That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone. With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things. The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card. This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card. Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and constantly lose the signal. So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card. Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process. It was WAY more frustration than it was worth. It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential. Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable. I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place. What a waste.",9

In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen. Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon. I've had it for a week and it works great. Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook). It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper. And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse. I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2. Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right. I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better!",3

The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone. It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3. It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing. This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone. If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed. Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing. I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them. I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice. Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small. I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to. If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go.",12

This Asha 302 phone is just that - all of the Symbian S40 simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware. The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional. The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan. Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all. Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting. Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some. I may get myself another one or two for the future, as I bet this is the end-run for this type of practical phone.",1

"Lumia 625 Windows Phone (Unlocked, 8GB, White)",Nokia,248.99,1,"I really wanted to love this phone. I loved the windows 8.1 home screen with live tiles and Cortana was excellent. The phone itself was built pretty solid. However, the cons far outweigh the pros. I had to do a hard reset on this phone THREE TIMES within the span of two weeks. First, it would not connect to wifi. Secondly, it kept rebooting itself (one day, it rebooted itself TEN TIMES.) Lastly, the phone was frozen in time one morning. The phone eventually shut off one day and would never turn back on. The phone completely died on me. I don't know if this was a software problem or if it was the phone itself, but I am so disappointed and will never buy a Windows phone again.",0
"Lumia 625 Windows Phone (Unlocked, 8GB, White)",Nokia,248.99,4,"I love this phone. I gave up my Nokia Lumia 1520 because I had to switch back to Sprint and its antenna doesn't work for Sprint. I got an LG G3 which I'm very happy with. But then I missed the Windows phone OS. I missed Cortana, the live tiles, the here maps, the am/fm radio, the rolodex style app list and contacts list and the dedicated camera button. So, I bought this Lumia 625 from this seller. To my pleasant surprise, it came with an orange housing as well. I thought I was only getting a white phone. I was able to update it to WP 8.1, not too easily but after trying for 4-5 times, I got it. I bought a prepaid sim card from AT&T and loaded it up with a $25 monthly charge. The camera isn't so good but that's the only thing negative about this phone. I also missed the 4.7 inch screen that I had with my Galaxy S3 before switching to the 1520 then to G3.",0

"Lumia900 Factory Unlocked Smartphone with Windows Phone 7.5, 8 MP Camera, 4.3-inch Touch Screen, 16 GB Memory and Wi-Fi - No Warranty - Black",Nokia,288.88,5,"This phone is absolutely fantastic for the price, but some potential buyers may not be fully aware of what to expect when it arrives.First off this phone is actually an unlocked AT&T Lumia 900, so there will be AT&T branding on the front. This means that the original packaging will already be opened, as the seller needs to manually unlock the phone before they ship it to you. This does NOT mean that it is a used phone. In order to be able to use non-AT&T sim cards, it is necessary for the seller to contact AT&T to receive an unlock code that frees it from the AT&T network. In my order, there was hardly any sign that it was handled at all, except for maybe a little finger print on the front glass. All the essential documents from AT&T and Nokia were inside the box, as well as a SIM ejector tool and a power cable.As is stated in the description, this phone will work on any HSPA/WCDMA 850/900/1900/2100 MHz/Quad-band data network and any GSM/GPRS/EDGE: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz cellular network, which in turn opens it for carriers in Europe and some in Asia. For US providers, there are currently only 2 major carriers that have GSM networks: AT&T and T-Mobile. There are other smaller carriers that offer services, but they utilize AT&T and T-Mobile towers in their coverage. These carriers include Straight Talk, Red Pocket Mobile, i Wireless, etc., and offer really affordable prepaid plans that I myself utilize. T-Mobile also offers a $30 a month prepaid plan that is rather reasonable.Unfortunately this phone will not work on any CDMA networks, which rules out Verizon, Sprint and US Cellular. For more information on the differences between CDMA and GSM networks, PCMAG.com has a fairly easy to read article explaining the differences between the two.Now onto the phone itself. I must say that I love this phone. It has a fairly decent Amoled 4.3 inch display, with a resolution of only 800x480. In our modern age of 1280×720 and above screens that may seem rather paltry. While using the phone normally it is looks as good as any other screen, but when watching YouTube videos it's lack of pixels becomes apparent. For me I use my iPad and laptop for watching videos so it doesn't matter to me all that much, but for others it may be a deal breaker.The build of the phone is absolutely fantastic. It is made of a solid polycarbonate body that is very resistant to scratches, with a screen made of Corning Gorilla Glass. Needless to say, it is very sturdy. The screen also seems to attract a large number of fingerprints as well, and for some reason is not all that easy to clean off. There is even a YouTube video where a hammer, saw and nail are taken to it and it comes up with little or no damage. The only thing on the phone that seems to be somewhat damageable is the metal piece around the camera lens. After less than 24 hours, there were already little scratches visible. For me I don't really care too much about it, but for others it may be really irritating.The camera itself is 8 megapixels with a Carl Zeiss lens, and it is just ok. There are certainly better phone cameras out there, with the iPhone 5 and Lumia 920 blowing it out of the water. For me it works best outdoors, as indoor shots tend to have more noise for whatever reason.This phone uses Windows Phone 7.5 Mango, so it is not the brand new Windows Phone 8. Sad thing about this phone is that it will never receive an update to Windows Phone 8. The hardware is just unable to fully handle the new OS. Instead it will receive Windows Phone 7.8, which gives it some Windows Phone 8 functionality, such as resizable tiles and the like. But apps in the future will cater just to Windows Phone 8, meaning that those with 7.8 and below will be left out in the cold with newer apps. Again, this isn't a deal breaker for me but for many it will be.One of the things that attracted me to this phone is Nokia Drive. Unlike most smartphone map applications, it does not require data in order to run. Before you set out on a trip you download fully detailed maps onto your phone, and then the built in GPS chip is used to map your location on the map. You can even download state or country specific maps, so you save space by not downloading the entire US map pack. All of this is done without data usage, which is great if you are traveling abroad. Oh, and it is completely free of charge. For travelers like myself, this is an awesome feature. I am also a student, so having a mobile version of Microsoft Office in my pocket is absolutely wonderful, for it allows me to edit documents while on the go.Overall this is a fantastic phone but definitely shows its age (close to one year). However, its awesome build quality as well as fantastic applications for travelers made it a must have for me. It fits my needs well, but potential buyers will need to consider whether it will work well for them.",28

Amount of available apps is perfectly sufficient for me. Image quality from camera falls a bit behind Lumia 950, but the price is unbeatable.

I didn't love the iphone os and it made me miss my windows os, yet I did adore the phone itself. However when it broke and had no warranty I decided to change it and buy again a windows phone. However, my return has not been great. Obviously this is a budget phone, but it does feel like a downgrade. I find that in the year I've been gone from the operating system there haven't been any improvement. There is still no Snapchat, google maps, and the app store feels worse than before. I also feel like the phone itself is slow some times and unresponsive. What I do love is the OS, despite the lack of apps I still adore the tile based UI that made me fall in love with it. Also, the xbox live integration actually makes me want to play games. It also feels and despite the price looks nifty. I am waiting for the surface phone to upgrade, but I do admit that if it doesn't have something mindblowing might have to return to iOS or Android .",2

I've used some ""budget"" Windows phones from Nokia and decided to give the 950 a try a few months ago since it was being offered at a big discount to retail on Amazon. I liked Windows because I don't use a lot of apps (10-15 usually will do it) and all the ones I do use are on the platform -- if you are an ""app for everything person"" then Windows phones are likely not for you. The Windows 10 os makes *significant* improvements over the previous os and it feels like a well integrated, intelligent system to use. The build quality is at least equal to the Nexus phones and a step up from other Lumias I've used. Overall if you like Windows this is a terrific phone.",3

If I had a use for it I'd get the dock, but at $90 it's a bit much for an impulse buy. It's pretty fast and fluid as well, and despite all you hear about the app gap I have pretty much everything I need on the phone.When I got it, though, it would kill the battery in half a day and get really hot. It turned out that the SD card that was working fine in my 1520 wasn't good enough for the 950. You need a really fast card. That fixed the heat and battery drain, though it definitely isn't as good on battery as the 1520 was. I also have issues logging into wifi hotspots, where a login page is needed.

The only one original Microsoft Nokia Lumia 640 item in the package was the label on top of the ZTE-label. To my fully disappointment, I also found the exact ZTE- cell phone for 59US$ at Amazon.com. Now, the cell phone is in Brazil and not working. I am very disappointed!",0

The tile UI for organizing apps is also very nice.Windows does not have the same level of App coverage as iOS or Android. So, that is a pain. For example, Uber App on the phone barely works.

So the phone comes like is should, with the charger, USB cable, 2500 removable battery and the phone itself, a AT&T sim and a printed paper with the instructions for make the phone fully unlocked as well.Which totally worked for me on the first try (remember that after 10 failed attempts the phone is no longer able to be unlocked, so do it carefully). I am not going to make a review about the software, because I am part of the Windows 10 Insider program and already upgraded this phone to W10 Mobile. So I am not going to make software reviews on a beta OS just yet but for me battery life is good so far.The phone fells good in the hand, the screen is really good for the density of pixels it has and the performance so far with games is decent. The main camera is average but still better than older Lumias like 820 and 535. The front facing camera is ok but if you want to upload selfies to Instagram will look washed out until you get a really good light to compensate the noise and lack of resolution.What I really love is that, with this same hardware, an Android phone is lagging so bad and Windows Mobile (beta) and Windows Phone 8.1 are rocking better.For the rest as a power user you can't beat this price. For the people asking in Latin American countries for this phone, I repeat, the Lumia 640 RM-1073 that sells CrazyLowPricesForYou you can use this phone with your local carrier (just check the frecuency bands are compatible with your carrier). I test it with Movistar and Kolbi in Costa Rica. This phone cost me 56 mil colones ($120) going through taxes and shipping here. My parents and some friends want some of this phones so I am going to order more but if you look for a better camera and better battery life look for the Lumia 640 XL.

It's simple, fast, and intuitive. Android might have the apps, but frankly its interface is clunky. Windows, in terms of looks, is right up there with iPhone even if it lacks some of the functionality. I also love its ability to manage my professional life. I never have to worry about what appointments my work has scheduled me for, because the minute I turn it on, it's all there, even if I haven't accepted the invite yet. This is actually incredibly useful to me, because I have a poor memory and sometimes forget to accept these invites. Cortana is super responsive as well.",3

However, I was pleasantly surprised by how clear the screen is outside in the sunlight and how responsive this little 5"" display phone reacted. No lag. I am even running the latest windows 10 insider upgrade without any issues on it.Ever since Android came out starting with the Verizon Droid, I have used Android. I played with the Lumia 1600 but just toooo big for my pockets. I love the response but went back to Android. Truth of the matter, yes Windows doesn't have all the apps that Android has but they have what I need. The most important ones were my banking app and it is available from Windows store so I am able to do what I do which is just email, calendar, text, occasion web, GPS where I need to go, mobile banking, and Facebook and messenger. I don't watch movies so this little puppy does just what I need and it does it quite well. For the price, I can't beat it. The Windows OS gets a lot of heat but compared to Android, it is much more fluid and fast. Sure there are more expensive Android phones with higher specs but why spend the money when you only do what I do everyday?",1

Gave my iPhone6 to my wife and now use the Lumina640. It is not as good as the iPhone6! This is clear. But The price is 1/8 ! So, no complaints. I had to upgrade the O/S to Win10. Win8.1, which was on the phone isnt good enough. The upgrading was a hassle, since the phone is AT&T branded, the upgrade did not work the normal way. I had to get the Early user Win10 in the Microsoft APP store for the upgrade. Found nstructions on Youtube. That worked well. I like the phone a lot overall! What I need to get used to is a) the way to answer calls - often I turn away a call when I want to answer it. And texting also caused issues at times - text seemed to go to wrong numbers. Did not find out why. But for those, who use windows and outlook, this is a great phone.",0

The front and back camera are good, especially when combined with Lumia Selfie and Lumia Camera, allowing you to control a lot of elements in the photo. Windows 8 runs perfectly, but the Windows 10 update is still a LITTLE buggy. Read reviews complaining about how its ""not compatible with apps like google play"" with a grain of salt because each OS has its own store. IE you cant get the android store on iOS.Windows lets me seamlessly switch between my CPU, Laptop, Tablet, and Phone easily. The windows store is not as heavily stocked with apps as Apple or Android. Apps run by google are also restricted. For instance things like Youtube don't have an official app, but they are easily replaced with other apps such as Tube Pro. It has all the popular and essential games and apps but dont expect new apps to instantly develop after they have been released on iOS or Android.This is an amazing phone and I've used Samsung, Apple, LG, and HTC before.The OS' store is it's only ""downside""If you want the most customization and apps and are familiar with using smartphones get an android, as many techies prefer.If you want apps and a friendly user experience get an Apple.If you want a friendly experience, customization, and phone that you can easily transition from your computer, tablet, etc to, then get a Windows.This is a great phone with amazing software but a sub par store.",8

It just has some minor problems.There are some really bad pre-installed apps that you can't delete (FM Radio, Internet Explorer, etc.). You can counter this by choosing custom apps in the store, however Windows doesn't have nearly the same selection/variety that Android Smartphones have.Microsoft Office is really good on the go for those moments a burst of inspiration one might get without having a pen and paper available to jot down ideas. There is also OneDrive storage available for any of your file needs--Or you can insert a Micro SD of your choosing. Nearly half of the phone's 8GB storage is used on system files.Had no problems using the phone/messaging programs. Make sure you read the details about which companies are suitable for it.

New Nokia Lumia 1320 GSM Unlocked LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black (No Warranty),Nokia,99.99,3,"I recently answered a question on whether the phone I bought was a clone or prefab. It is not a Nokia Android clone of the Windows8 OS. If it is a prefab, I don't know. As I stated in the response, I thought Nokia manufactured their phones in Sweden not in Hong Kong. Probably assembled in China and distributed to the International market out of Hong Kong. The phone was preconfigured for the Hong Kong Market. Though it was in Hong Kong English, it was easy enough to reset the phone without losing the app bundle it came with. Apps were enough for video+music, camera, a driving navigator, a walking map, public transit, some Nokia proprietary apps that work well; like the panoramic camera app that stiches together about 4 pictures. The Mobile office suite excel, power point and word, with office 365 to sync with your other MS Office software. I had to install a third party file manager app to access files on my SD card. 8 gigs onboard mem is ok. Though if you want to save maps directly to the onboard mem, memory be eaten up fast. I loaded about 7 apps and have 2.68 gigs left. I mentioned that maps, because even though I asked the maps to load to the SD card, they did not. I was happy they didn't, because transferring the SD card from my phone to my tablet, corrupted the data. I doubt it was an issue with the phone. However, I was overseas and needed the maps, and was thankful that they were on the phone's memory. The phone arrived about a week before the ""no later than date"" which was about 3 weeks. I am rating this particular purchase at three stars for 3 reasons. First, the phone has a black back case and not red, as requested. Sounds trivial, but I wonder what else was not ""as advertised""? For example, at the vendor you will get the latest OS with the latest bundle. I got Windows 8.0, where at the vendor, the phone was loaded with Windows 8.1. Maybe not a big deal until I actually ask to upgrade the OS. Second, the phone runs hot when browsing the internet and also using GPS actively (GPS when in flight mode). So I wonder about the CPU. It is a 1.7 dual core, but so is my tablet that doesn't run hot (significantly hot). I wonder if the phone is a prefab or if the chip is overclocked (inferior chip running faster than advised) to save on money. Third, the initial price was attractive at about $277, but after paying $23 to ship to an FPO AE, the savings of purchasing online didn't really outweigh the peace of mind of purchasing the same phone at a local vendor, where I can walk over and have it serviced or returned immediately if necessary. I would have paid $70 more at the local vendor. The battery life is decent lasting a whole day with some web browsing, watching around 1.5hrs of video, using the GPS and a few short phone calls. When I did notice the phone getting hot, it did consume more battery life that usual. I was slightly worried that the G4 standard here in Italy would not be compatible with the frequency published, but it works great. Sometimes a webpage will hang, other times pages will pop right up. The webpages hanging are starting to get annoying. The Windows8 interface for me is a breath of fresh air compared the Android OSs that I use on my Samsung tablets. I find the interface to be simpler and quicker for that matter.",3

This is indeed an international phone the wall adapter that came with my phone is NOT for the USA. I am glad I have a number of usb wall adaptors that seem to do the trick. The instruction book and default settings are for HONG KONG though easy enough to go through the setup and make changes. The default back on the phone I received was black, not red as in the picture, but I am ok with that. The box arrived quickly and it was obvious that, while new, this had been open and a simple piece of regular tape was over the end and the bag on the phone was fingerprinted up, though I can not tell anything is wrong and the phone seems to work great both on wifi, and over the data from my provider.Overall glad I got this phone but just be aware that you will need a USB wall adaptor that is for USA if you live here.",2

New Nokia Lumia 1320 GSM Unlocked LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black (No Warranty),Nokia,99.99,5,"Beside windows 8 and 8.1's store lacking some apps the phone is amazing. Being mostly an android user, and before this being on iPhone 5, this phone was very easy to get used to. I loved my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and this phone, if you like large phones, is perfect. Not as big as the Sony Xperia Z Ultra, which is a little too big, but nicely larger then the note 2. The home screen is a little weird to get used too if you are not used to windows 8 on a computer or tablet, but it becomes very handy as you get to choose what you want on the home screen and what you dont want, plus you get to pick from a nice group of colors for your theme. The app drawer when you swipe left is great with a nice search list. The 720p screen isn't as bad as people think, everyone thinks its all about pixels, but you can get nice crisp 720p screens, just like this phone has. With Nokia Black colors on this phone stand out and you get great viewing angles and outside the screen is just as nice, Nokia has done great with there black screen technology. Another thing Nokia has done well is built this phone, but Nokia has a great reputation and builds all there phones like mini tanks!! They also have great battery life. The only minor downfall of Windows Phone is the small lack of apps and games, but the store is growing everyday so that shouldn't last long.Pros: -Build Quality -Large crisp screen -Windows Phone is a great android alternative, especially since its growing and growing everyday.* -Batter Life, can get 2+ days with moderate use, 1 to 1 1/2 days with heaver use. -Camera button, i love having the separate button for just the camera.Cons: -Windows Phone, at the time of this review, lacks some games and apps that android has.Overall i would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a break from android or just wants a whole new experience with this great phone! Coming from IOS to this was a great change and i would have to say, between android and WP8 i would have to say with WP growing and growing WP8 has to be my new favorite OS!!",5
New Nokia Lumia 1320 GSM Unlocked LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black (No Warranty),Nokia,99.99,5,"When I decided to purchase this phone it was mainly to avoid a new contract. After using it I this its better than many of the new flagship phones. It may not be as fast, but the screen size means I really don't need a tablet. I have big hands so the size is right for me. It will be too big for people with small hands. It is also able to run the new update to windows phone 8.1 when it comes out. Works just fine one AT&T but not at LTE speeds.",9

New Nokia Lumia 1320 GSM Unlocked LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black (No Warranty),Nokia,99.99,4,"Well first I am a person who makes a review after a good couple of weeks of using it and in this case it was well over a couple of months. Also, I am very computer savvy person (if you know what I mean...)It is fast smooth and certainly feels like a great phone! The main downsides are that its an international version (thus does not work with 4G or LTE or 3G for that fact) but it still works with 2G (note: I use T-Mobile). Now I know there is a variant of a United States model of this phone which is called the RM-995 model version and that is another $100 more than this one (I bought this one for $350). Now I know its not fair to judge a phone because of its these kinds of limitation but the loss of a ""star"" is because of the lack of support from the company when I asked it some simple questions (such as does this work for T-Mobile and does 4G/LTE/3G work)...but over all it is an awesome phone and I do not regret my decision buying this phone!",22

New Nokia Lumia 1320 GSM Unlocked LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black (No Warranty),Nokia,99.99,5,"Second try: Even though I returned the first one, I thought I would try ordering this phone again because I still wanted it and have all the accessories I purchased for the first one. I am happy to report that I actually received the International version (RM-994) and not the Chinese version. This phone actually connected to T-Mobile and my Internet account without issue. I have been using the phone for several hours now without the unusual heating up that happened with the original purchase. I'll update this if anything crazy happens, but so far I am a happy camper. Warning for other interested buyers, make sure you get the correct version!Original:Within the first two days I've had this phone, I've encountered a few problems. First, the phone I received is not the ""International version"" and is instead the Chinese version (RM-994 vs RM-996). This seems to remove LTE and 4G capabilities. For unknown reasons, the phone became HOT when I was trying to figure out how to set up my network. It would also shut off randomly. A factory reset fixed that issue, but seeing as how it's a Chinese phone, it rebooted back in Chinese. I had to figure out how to get it back to English while also trying to get it past the factory reset instructions. After that, I still could not get it to access the network even after I went through troubleshooting with a tech for hours. During the last attempt, the phone stopped charging. I tried to wiggle the cord, remove it and reinsert it, and plugged other phones and tablets into the charger (which all charged). After that, I decided to be done. I know this phone has great capabilities, but the one I received was a lemon. I am returning it.",1

New Nokia Lumia 1320 GSM Unlocked LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black (No Warranty),Nokia,99.99,3,"I recently answered a question on whether the phone I bought was a clone or prefab. It is not a Nokia Android clone of the Windows8 OS. If it is a prefab, I don't know. As I stated in the response, I thought Nokia manufactured their phones in Sweden not in Hong Kong. Probably assembled in China and distributed to the International market out of Hong Kong. The phone was preconfigured for the Hong Kong Market. Though it was in Hong Kong English, it was easy enough to reset the phone without losing the app bundle it came with. Apps were enough for video+music, camera, a driving navigator, a walking map, public transit, some Nokia proprietary apps that work well; like the panoramic camera app that stiches together about 4 pictures. The Mobile office suite excel, power point and word, with office 365 to sync with your other MS Office software. I had to install a third party file manager app to access files on my SD card. 8 gigs onboard mem is ok. Though if you want to save maps directly to the onboard mem, memory be eaten up fast. I loaded about 7 apps and have 2.68 gigs left. I mentioned that maps, because even though I asked the maps to load to the SD card, they did not. I was happy they didn't, because transferring the SD card from my phone to my tablet, corrupted the data. I doubt it was an issue with the phone. However, I was overseas and needed the maps, and was thankful that they were on the phone's memory. The phone arrived about a week before the ""no later than date"" which was about 3 weeks. I am rating this particular purchase at three stars for 3 reasons. First, the phone has a black back case and not red, as requested. Sounds trivial, but I wonder what else was not ""as advertised""? For example, at the vendor you will get the latest OS with the latest bundle. I got Windows 8.0, where at the vendor, the phone was loaded with Windows 8.1.

I would have paid $70 more at the local vendor. The battery life is decent lasting a whole day with some web browsing, watching around 1.5hrs of video, using the GPS and a few short phone calls. When I did notice the phone getting hot, it did consume more battery life that usual.

The box arrived quickly and it was obvious that, while new, this had been open and a simple piece of regular tape was over the end and the bag on the phone was fingerprinted up, though I can not tell anything is wrong and the phone seems to work great both on wifi, and over the data from my provider.Overall glad I got this phone but just be aware that you will need a USB wall adaptor that is for USA if you live here.",2

Nokia - 106.3 Negro/black Unlocked Dualband GSM 850/1900,Nokia,269.1,4,"So far it's a decent phone. I've owned similar Nokia phones for several years now and they have always been very reliable. For ~$26, I don't want to be overly critical but I do wish the call quality were better. I read a lot of rave reviews prior to purchasing and almost all of the reviews mentioned great call quality but that has not been my experience. My previous phone was a Nokia Xpress Music (old school!) and the call quality on that phone was always good so I don't think it's me.It came with a headphone set. My ears tend to be on the larger size and I still found the ear buds to be too large.Pros:Inexpensive!Decent battery life (several days even after making multiple calls)You won't ever be caught ignoring your kids staring at a smart phone all day!Cons:Fair to mediocre call qualityNo Bluetooth capabilityEar buds are largeIf you have never owned a Nokia, be sure to read the instruction manual. I was used to having buttons on the side of the phone to adjust the volume. It took me a while to figure out the volume is adjusted only while in-call by using the left and right joystick button.",10

Well, there are some low-tech ones: a pretty functional LED light, an FM radio, and a changeable back plate that is supposed to come in different colors. The only direct competitor that I have found is the Samsung Keystone 2, and while that phone has a better form factor (no one has mentioned that this phone is large) this one has the better interface.

Nokia - 106.3 Negro/black Unlocked Dualband GSM 850/1900,Nokia,269.1,3,"I bought this phone so that I could have a phone with no internet, as partial ""unplug"" thing. It works great, although there are a few drawbacks. It has a very small SMS memory, so the inbox fills up pretty quickly. It doesn't have a way to auto-delete oldest first, so you have to either delete everything, including your newest messages, or individually delete each older message, which gets time consuming. I text a lot, so that's a big annoyance for me.I also wish that you could send it a picture via MMS (since there's no data port and no internet, that leaves only MMS) to set as a background picture. Alas, it doesn't handle MMS at all. That also makes receiving group messages nearly impossible, as most smartphones send group messages as MMS instead of SMS.Call quality is pretty good though, and it came with a handsfree wired (it doesn't have bluetooth) headset.The SIM tray is easy to use; because it is a tray, not a slot, I was able to insert the micro-SIM from my smartphone without any trouble.Battery life is excellent.

Fortunately, one doesn't have to open it often, once the SIM card is in, so we will keep it as a back up to the Samsung which we immediately ordered. And fortunately, the cost is low and it probably will serve our needs to use it only as an emergency type phone.",0

Nokia - 106.3 Negro/black Unlocked Dualband GSM 850/1900,Nokia,269.1,5,"I've owned a series of Android phones and finally got exasperated with a computer (way more powerful than the Apollo flight control computer) combined with an afterthought phone. It takes way too many menus just to MAKE A CALL. I wanted a PHONE first. Plus the awful battery life: less than a 12-hour day with any real use. So I have turned back the clock 10 years to a phone that does nothing other than CALL and TEXT. OK, yes there is an FM Radio which actually is nice. I took this on a business trip: after four days of light use, battery was still at 60% (3 of 5 bars). I didn't charge it when home until it had gone a whole week and was down to 2 bars of battery. That is impressive. Call quality is OK, not great. The controls are pretty intuitive (the flashlight just takes an up press on the 4-way rocker. I can dial a call in way less time than my touchscreen smartphone. If I need GPS, etc, I take along my Nexus tablet, and can usually find hotspots along the way. It does only simple SMS, can't even read MMS, so far I am OK with that. The battery life alone makes this a great phone. I got extra batteries so all I need to do is carry one of them instead of a big charger. This phone takes the tiny Nokia barrel connector, it is NOT the common micro USB. Phone book, calculator, other features work fine. I've dropped it onto a cork or wood floor a couple of times: the back came off, battery came out, but no damage. This is a great phone if you hate the complexity and frustration of a ""smart"" phone. Not to mention the cost: $25 vs $200 to $600. You can buy a really nice 7"" or lrager tablet with the money you save!",0

Since the phone doesn't work with T-Mobile, the product description is mistaken at best, and at worst deliberately misleading.EDIT: Changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars because this *does* work on T-Mobile, but only if you are in T-Mobile 2G coverage (900Mhz and 1800Mhz bands), which may not be the case even if you have LTE (smartphone) coverage. If you only have AT&T coverage, this Nokia 106 will need to be turned on in an area with T-Mobile 2G coverage, after which the phone will thereafter recognize even weak T-Mobile 2G signals.

I did, the manufacturers used a cheap glue to glue the screen in. But it gets worse. The design is very bad.

Not the phone's fault, of course; I just didn't do my research well enough.If you are mainly going to be making phone calls, this phone is GREAT. It's light and small, buttons feel good, battery life is long, and the phone is solid as a rock like Nokia always is. I love Nokia, and this one feels like a warhorse, just like the Nokia 6030 that I bought eight years ago that this 106 replaced.

Nokia - 106.3 Negro/black Unlocked Dualband GSM 850/1900,Nokia,269.1,4,"So far it's a decent phone. I've owned similar Nokia phones for several years now and they have always been very reliable. For ~$26, I don't want to be overly critical but I do wish the call quality were better. I read a lot of rave reviews prior to purchasing and almost all of the reviews mentioned great call quality but that has not been my experience. My previous phone was a Nokia Xpress Music (old school!) and the call quality on that phone was always good so I don't think it's me.It came with a headphone set. My ears tend to be on the larger size and I still found the ear buds to be too large.Pros:Inexpensive!Decent battery life (several days even after making multiple calls)You won't ever be caught ignoring your kids staring at a smart phone all day!Cons:Fair to mediocre call qualityNo Bluetooth capabilityEar buds are largeIf you have never owned a Nokia, be sure to read the instruction manual.

Nokia - 106.3 Negro/black Unlocked Dualband GSM 850/1900,Nokia,269.1,3,"I bought this phone so that I could have a phone with no internet, as partial ""unplug"" thing. It works great, although there are a few drawbacks. It has a very small SMS memory, so the inbox fills up pretty quickly. It doesn't have a way to auto-delete oldest first, so you have to either delete everything, including your newest messages, or individually delete each older message, which gets time consuming. I text a lot, so that's a big annoyance for me.I also wish that you could send it a picture via MMS (since there's no data port and no internet, that leaves only MMS) to set as a background picture. Alas, it doesn't handle MMS at all. That also makes receiving group messages nearly impossible, as most smartphones send group messages as MMS instead of SMS.Call quality is pretty good though, and it came with a handsfree wired (it doesn't have bluetooth) headset.The SIM tray is easy to use; because it is a tray, not a slot, I was able to insert the micro-SIM from my smartphone without any trouble.Battery life is excellent. I took this on a business trip for two weeks, using it to text and talk for a couple hours each day, and only had to charge it a few times.",

This is all I'm looking for, an easy to use and great looking phone.1. Excellent signal2. Email account support3. Social Networks4. Great battery life5. Great camera6. Light weight7. Nice screen that you can touch and no need for navigation key",5
Nokia - Asha 300 Gray Touchscreen Unlocked QuadBand 3G Cell Phone,Nokia,129.99,4,"So far this phone is everything I expected; its easy to use, has a decent processor, stable software, good camera and lots of apps to download.But it has some limitations I was simply not expecting to see in a new Nokia phone:- The camera despite having a decent quality is has none of the basic options other simpler phones provide, it lacks filters, color modes, and even brigthness adjusment.- The battery life can be kind of short, I don't make many calls but I do browse the web a lot and this can consume the battery in just 2 days specially if you are using 3G.- The internet browser doesn't display most pages in the most ordely way one would expect and you have very little control over the zoom so you either see the pages from too far or you see them way to close, so much that the text sometimes gets compressed in a very thin column- It doesn't display menu options in spanish, despite being international and having, italian, french and portuguese language packages installed.Another problem I had was that the signal reception is kind of weak, but this One is mostly caused by my current carrier (MOVILNET) here in Venezuela. Aparently some carriers here are not very friendly with unlocked phones some apps that require internet accses like ""Whatsapp"" are not supported or barely suported, I had to change the data packet acces point manually to use internet and still I have a lot of limitations and I will probaly have to move to a more stable but expensive carrier like Digitel or Movistar.ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU CAN CONFIGURE ANY UNLOCKED PHONE YOU ARE GONNA BUY TO USE IT AT ITS FULLEST IN YOUR COUNTRY, READ LOTS OF REVIEWS, AND CONSULT FORUMS, YOU CAN'T JUST PUT A NEW SIM CARD EXPECT EVERYTHING TO WORK FINE SOMETIMES IS NOT THAT SIMPLE.",10
Nokia - Asha 300 Gray Touchscreen Unlocked QuadBand 3G Cell Phone,Nokia,129.99,5,"As you can expect from a Nokia phone, great performance. The only problem I had with it... no Spanish menus... that's not a problem for me, but it is for the person I bought the phone for.Maybe is because it's an International Version, besides that, great phone.",1

We purchased this for international travel. It worked ""ok"" for our purposes (calling, texting) but had serious issues randomly turning off, deleting messages, and poor call quality. I would definitely recommend spending the money rather on the newer Nokia Windows phones instead (which is what we did after this purchase). I wish I could get my money back for this phone.",0

But that's not a huge deal for me, since the whole point for me was to test web pages over WiFI.Unfortunately, WiFi doesn't actually work. I can't connect to my home network at all. Internet searches suggest the problem could be solved by adding an active SIM card. That's unlike pretty much every other WiFi-enabled phone on the market.",0
